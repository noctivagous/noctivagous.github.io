ASK WHAT DRAG AND DROP IS

Serves different functions:    
        - For document dropped onto Application icons:
            "Open this document"
        - For text: mouse-driven cut and paste.
        - For files dropped onto upload drop regions
        of a web page:
            "Here is the file's path (URL)"
    
    

COPY LINE / CUT-AND-PASTE LINE

    Copy line - Uses a drag-line to copy and paste
    between windows.  Acts as copy version of drag
    and drop.
    
    1) User selects some text (see nct-bimodal-selectclicks)
    in the source window and presses the copy line key.  The highlighted
    box for the text has a green outline indicating the copy line has begun.
    2) As the user moves the mouse, a line extends from the 
    point where the copy line was pressed to the point located at the cursor.
    It updates on every mouse move. It will activate any receiving 
    areas for text to show that they can receive text.
    3) After the user finds the destination drop area, he
    presses the copy line key a second time
    and it moves there as a clone (animated).
        - If it is a cut-and-paste operation, this action, of
        course, deletes the text selection in the source window.
