<h1>The Key-Click UI</h1>
<p>The key-click UI is an improved software user interface for the desktop computer.  

<br><br>A software program that implements the key-click UI treats the keys 
on a keyboard as click buttons.  The mouse buttons are entirely ignored.
Although this can be explained, before reading further, please try out the demo below.

<p>
The concept is that-- and real world use of the key-click UI has shown-- 
there is currently too much work assigned to a single mouse hand.  
Compared to the key-click UI, an individual hand is currently being burdened. 
It has to do two
things at once: coordinate the position of the cursor <i>and</i> click the buttons with the index finger.
In a vector-drawing program, especially, this is excessive; the
all-purpose mouse is supposed to stand in for a properly-designed
mechanical drawing machine setup.  It's actually that the mouse shouldn't be used
for drawing vectors without modifying the interface.


<!--
<p>The key-click UI is not in contradiction with the history of the mouse, as Douglas Engelbart's
  1968 demo of the mouse in fact also featured a .  During the demo, to the left of his keyboard
  he was using a five-key device in tandem with the mouse, which also had click buttons.  
  That five-key device did not make it into personal computers but its essence is the same as the key-click UI.
 </p>
-->



 <p>Separating the click from the mouse extends the job of
  manipulating cursor interactivity to two hands instead of one. This leads to a leap in possible dexterity.
  Each hand has its own role.  The mouse hand just moves the cursor and
  the clicking hand just clicks with keys.  This opens up a totally different interactive 
  dynamic with the desktop computer because previously there was never such alternation occuring between
  two hands (move, click, move, click).
 </p>



<h1>Demo</h1>
<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>This demo lets you draw vector lines (lines with multiple straight segments).</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>The gray rectangular area below accepts key presses:</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>— Press the "F" key after placing the cursor in the gray area.  Then move the mouse.</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>— Press "F" again to add another point.  You then move the mouse again.  Keep adding points as needed.</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>— To end drawing of the polyline, press one of three keys: "A", "E", or "R".</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>— Press "V" to thicken the stroke and "C" to thin the stroke of the polyline.</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item --></ul>
