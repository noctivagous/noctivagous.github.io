<h1>Introduction</h1>



<p>
  <!-- Computer Code, Including Python, Is Still in Plain Text-->

Though AI is currently introducing a new paradigm to the world, 
there is still much about computers that needs to be upgraded.
<!-- 

The assumed role that AI will serve in society is questionable,
that it will take over everything for the better rather than
exist as a specific culture of human existence.

<p> 
The generation of code is seen as evidence that the role of the
programmer will diminish over time.  Who is saying, though,
that the role of an architect will diminish over time with
respect to building plans?  More likely than not AI will simply 
alter the dynamic of writing code because it is only in a scenario
in which computers are not instructed by professionals that professionals
disappear from the situation.  What would make the future AGI, after
all?  Any use of AI for writing
computer programs will immediately hit the ceiling that 
<p>
-->
First, computer code files should be made out of structured data. 
Source code is still stored and processed as plain text. 
In practice, this is utilized in modern software development 
as if it provides structured data even though it remains a 
basic stream of characters.  All recent trends in software engineering 
are moving in this direction, which is the modernization of code's 
interactivity, applied to its exterior instead of 
carrying it out in a planned way by upgrading its file format.   
An unconscious dynamic is playing out in which programmers 
unwittingly seek an upgrade to code's interactivity because they
are using code in larger volumes and in more complex ways
than in previous decades.
But they add it to code editors with elaborate strategies to make
it work for plain text.  The corresponding software engineering need
is not met, the upgrade of code's file format.
The software engineering community is not 
awakening to the absurdity of the situation that this is plain text
and it shouldn't be treated as if it naturally supports anything 
more interactively, like collapsible sections. 
For example, the notebook code editors (e.g. Jupyter Notebook) intended for data science 
and developing AI place the Python programming language (plain text) into an 
interactive format, providing an input prompt with graphical output 
responses, but this is actually just a well-constructed set of hacks; 
Python itself has not been upgraded 
to behave like this and it doesn't normally support this usage. 
All the same, after this upgrade to Python code was implemented, 
the interactive code notebook became an essential tool of the AI community.
It is a demonstration that when code's form is upgraded the results will provide immense
benefits.  It's just that these notebooks 
 came about as a result of someone's personal objectives; the people working in data science just
wanted Python to behave in a certain way for their own particular needs
and they weren't thinking about the broader implications, which is that if they
want Python to behave interactively and also produce graphical output they have 
in actuality run up against the walls of how typewritten
code has always existed for making and sketching out software.
<!-- The software engineer is just proceeding to get what he wants
out of it.-->

 <!-- It's another example of where
  the upgrade of computer code is taking an indirect, unconscious route and therefore
  the process is quite slow compared to a concerted effort that would
  design the code files with structured data .-->
  
  <!--
  <p>AI is unlikely to displace the professionals who instruct
  computers because as long as computers take complex
  instructions there will be people who produce them for the computers.
  Otherwise the computers would all turn into intelligent, autonomous black boxes,
  accepting no complex commands from people, and they would have departed from
  the condition that people even use instructions or commands (code)
  to build them from the ground up.   The commands computers take will not 
  be the same as literature.  
 
  In the same way, if AI generates plans for office buildings, there will still need to be professionals like
  architects who tell the AI what is wanted by the future building owners for the building and
  this is always going to be a complex matter and will be the domain of professionals
  for a long time even if it is the entirety of a moon-sized habitation being constructed 
  with future technology within a matter of days, because, as we said elsewhere, whatever AI generates
  today carries the style and characteristics of AI.  At issue is
  society's (current lack of) understanding that human professional expertise extends
  beyond skill and labor to what is also the menu of options suitable for
  any situation that people want, such as what type of lobby would be desired for
  that office building, the latest experimentation in styles of lobbies, etc.

  If people are removed from what exists around people then it would be a culture of AI machines
  evolving their own lobby styles over the years for the office buildings,
  telling humans what they are to live in.
  Human culture then would disappear because its evolution
  would be taking place by AI and within AI and humans would just
  be inhabitants of what AI made with the passage of time.
  
  If AI is made to generate code then the code should be more sophisticated than what exists today
  within the plain text file format.
  -->
  
  <p>
    Meanwhile, in mainstream software development, IDEs are increasingly 
    providing enhancements to code that improve its interactive capabilities
    as well, to provide greater control and navigation.  But to do this, they 
    have to project 
     non-existent structure onto the plain text (.TXT) code for the benefit of 
     the user: they analyze it constantly in the background to make 
     collapsible code sections with GUI arrow controls, they generate
     dropdown menus at the top of the window 
     with organized sections of the file's contents, and they
     display code completion popover windows. They extracted this information
     by processing a basic file of plain text.
     In other words, the common IDE has begun to treat 
     a single file of code (.TXT) as a conventional application document (e.g. XML),
     which is a very hacky activity, but the phenomenon is happening in an unrecognized 
     way. The code editor undertakes user interface gymnastics with this stream
      of ASCII characters to implement all of the modern code editing features that appeared
      in the last decade (such as the mini maps that now sit to the side)
      and when those features are added they are a reflection of how code is
      more complex than before and the code bases are larger.  This is why
      there has to be a retrofitting, like placing beams and columns in an
      old building.  That retrofitting would be, to begin with, the onscreen rendering 
      of current code syntax by reading files made out of XML or structured data.
      
      <p>
      The most honest picture of how code exists today is available 
      by opening up a file in a basic text editor like Microsoft's Notepad. 
      Everything else code can offer the software engineer today that is interactive
      is actually a hack placed on top, including keyword coloring (code, of course, provides no coloring 
      data in the plain text file data).  IDEs and the software engineering
      community are avoiding the most important task a software engineer would
      take up in any other situation, which is to
      move up to an application document file format for each file of code.
      Otherwise, the bizarre advances continue to play out, the hot-rodding of .TXT just to keep it
      around as the primary medium of computer programming because people
      are worried that a substantial upgrade won't fit into what exists now.

<p>
When computer code's file 
format is upgraded to a document file format—
comprised of markup like XML— and the contents are rendered 
inside the code editor from the XML (of course just like a web page is 
rendered from its HTML), the capabilities available to the
programming language designers will become much broader,
in many directions, from lines of code that contain multiple rows 
to diagrams that describe complex processes. 
It will be possible to mix node-based programming and procedural
code inside the same document, which is valuable flexibility for
the programmer. There will be a 
meaningful job for the graphic designer
to assist in the layout and appearance of code, for the first time. 
 A file of code will allow providing more than one representation of 
 its data, but this will be natural to implement when the code file is made of
markup whereas it would be rough job to make this for today's 
.TXT-based code.

<p>
  Many benefits will emerge when code is finally converted to a formal document format
  from the ground up, in many different areas, including a leap in 
  parseability by the compilers and the IDEs, as 
  they will be parsing structured data like XML instead of plain text.
   Plain text carries much ambiguity for live parsing of code and so the 
   analyzers are not always accurate when just one character is off; 
   deleting just one curly brace can totally confuse the compiler.  
   When code is finally translated 
   into a document format, which will support a live review of code naturally, 
   the quality of users' experience with code will improve greatly and 
   most typographic mistakes will be preventable that halt compilation (such as 
   deleting a single character or omitting a semicolon).
    Many features will become feasible that no one
   would want to try with plain text today, such as the ability to
    survey a project of code in the form of a
    map or schematics overview.  It will be possible to zoom in and out of
    code just like CAD because the code files will have 
    formal structure inside them. 
   
   <p>
   Especially if the code files are made out of XML, 
   the ability to add attributes to the underlying markup will 
   take computer programming languages to a new level.  Whatever someone
   wants to render from the XML will specify what code can do, 
   not merely what is typed out one text character at a time.
    A function will not just show up in the markup as
    &lt;function&gt; but allow the insertion of custom attributes inside the &lt;function&gt; XML element 
      that provide for much broader configuration, rendered for the programmer code file.
       In addition, an individual line of code will be more powerful
        because it can contain more complex statements, permitting math notation,
	 A section of the document can be made out of graphical components and even allowing 
        interactive controls natively.  Assigning array object variables to 
       interactive data tables will be possible and this is something people need today. 
       A 3D object will be assignable to a 3D model viewer displaying the object inside the line of code.
         An object variable with many settings will be assignable to a tab view control 
         that has many configuration parameters for that object and it
         will appear that with GUI settings inside the document, in the line of code.
        A spline object variable will be assignable to a 
      spline editor control, where it can be edited inside the line of code.
      In the future, the programmer would be able to supply his own editors like this.


<!--<p>Some programming language concepts will be straightforward to implement that cannot 
enter the plain text file format, such as the following example.  Underneath the appearance
of many software programs is a grid. Whether 
it is checkers, chess, a calendar, tic-tac-toe, or the arcade snake game, they all could be viewed 
as stemming from an abstract or conceptual grid, one starts in a most generic and unmodified form.  
Many programmatic outcomes like these (anything whose form is a modified grid) 
can be described in terms of increasing specification of a generically 
existing grid component. Chess, checkers, and a calendar can come from the same programmatic component.
In the code it would start from the most generic, initial state 
and then the person begins customization.
What the grid is for is progressively described with accessory components, 
moving in the direction of a final outcome, and this would be included as 
a possible activity of programming. If it is the game of solitaire being built,
 then an accessory component related to stacks would be attached to the grid.  
 To provide a component like this in code will require displaying 
 graphics inside the code file and .TXT of course does not support this. 
 This versatile grid component, which has capabilities in many directions, 
 will need to display a representation of the grid itself, its components that specify what it does,
  and the relationships between them so that a game of tic-tac-toe 
  can be described in just a few diagrams. -->
  <!-- What's more, when images 
  are something that can be placed in the code file and made a feature 
  of the programming language itself, a set of instructions for the computer 
  can be described semiotically to show heuristic commands 
  (e.g. "try to avoid objects with this description").
  -->
  
  <p>
  The upgrade of code's file format means that many scenarios will be easily described in 
  terms of conditions, rules, states, etc. because computer code's presentation 
  capabilities will exist beyond .TXT. With all of these newer features provided 
  in code, existing software in use will be relatively easy and fast to rewrite 
  and when they are redone they will have more available in them. <!-- Most programming languages
  do not recognize state machines today. -->



 <p> 
  Resistance to changing the file format of code and modernizing 
  it often comes out of a lack of understanding of the problems 
  that result from keeping .TXT as the file format today, and addressing that 
  starts with some discussion about graphic design, a topic hardly ever
  paired with software engineering.
 For the graphic designer, though not necessarily
  the software engineer, once today's computer code is revealed as completely 
  tied to the raw .TXT file format, all of the feature differences 
  discussed among the programming languages are  
  taking place inside a tiny frame of view, 
  which is what can be typed into the .TXT file format, a sequence of ASCII or Unicode characters.   
The graphic designer knows immediately how limiting this is because, to begin with, the means of dividing information
on the page amounts to manually-typed line breaks, white space (tabs and spacebar), and nothing more. 
  Consider that in some programming languages, functions start and end 
 with the keywords "define" and "end" while in most others (C++, Java, C#) there are beginning and 
 ending curly braces.  To the graphic designer, all of this is using typographic characters 
 to establish box boundaries. The result is a mess of curly braces scattered
 down the page.  The only provided way to keep code tidy is through the tab key and this
 has no effect on how challenging it can be to track all of the nested curly braces and parentheses.  
 It's too primitive of a situation.  There is only a vertical division of information 
 (line breaks between sections of code) in plain text, 
 and nothing can flow horizontally.
 <p>
 In a programming language that is not constrained by .TXT, there will be no typing out of beginning and 
 ending curly braces just to establish the box boundaries of a body of code.  This a task the software
 engineer shouldn't have to deal with, the maintenance of box boundaries.   
 Instead, the contents of a function (or other code section) will be enclosed in a graphical, bordered box, 
 as the file of text will no longer be .TXT but rendered from a document format (e.g. rendered from XML).
 The bordered boxes (the containers for sections of code) will not only flow vertically as in plain text but 
 will be flowable horizontally at the same time, like how a magazine layout has multiple columns.
 At that point, the focus of the user interface will move away from simple typing to a more complex dynamic.
<!-- Replacing the curly braces will be the modifying, adding, or removing the bordered graphical boxes rapidly (the ones
that enclose the loops, functions, and other bodies of code). -->
 It will involve making use of interactive keyboard commands to control the layout and insertion of code, 
 not typing out '{' or '}', and the IDE will begin to resemble a media production app, like a vector-drawing program or animation program,
 because the code will be modernized; the code document will offer modern software capabilities. 
 The user interface principles will have to be more sophisticated than
 what is currently used for code, which is typing, and so discussed on this page are the key-click UI and
 other user interface concepts such as Noctivagous' npsurfer web browsing extension that demonstrates
 a UI for accessing a certain section of the screen quickly without the mouse. In short,
 future code interactivity should not rely on the mouse unless the mouse is used as part of the key-click UI.
 Reluctance to upgrading code is also frequently a result of apprehension by software engineers
 that the clicking mouse will be the focus instead of the much faster keyboard, which shows its
 strengths in the classic command line interface.

 
 <p>
  The replacement of curly brace characters with bordered boxes brings with it broad-ranging
  opportunities in other areas of code and what a document of code can offer the software engineer,
  including interactive components in a line of code that have a lot of power and configuration built in.
  Promisingly, it opens the possibility of customization of the programming language itself; the ability
  to add features to the code document (through scripting and descriptions) will naturally
  make sense as a feature of programming, far more than if the code is plain text.  The software engineer
  will be able to program his own interactive components that make up a line of code, tailored for his
  own project if necessary.
  <p>
  Just this one change demonstrates how the features of any mainstream programming language are currently
  severely confined to what the .TXT file format provides, as .TXT cannot draw graphical boxes and so it cannot
  draw anything else and is stuck in the early days of mainframe computing.  
  Speaking within the constraints of that primitive file format, it is a debate about what characters should 
  define the bounds of a function (will it be curly braces, line breaks, or keywords?) and all similar
  personal preferences, such as whether a line should end in semicolon.  But that kind of debate
 disappears when it is a graphical box enclosing the contents of a function.  When a line of code
 is rendered from XML it doesn't need to have semicolons terminating it.  Omitting a semicolon or 
 removing a single curly brace won't break the entire project of code, as is currently the case.
 <p>
 Thus, the design decisions that differentiate one programming language from another
  actually just exist within this limited and ubiquitous file format, plain text. 
  Since it is so restrictive, having no structured data inside it and being
  a 1:1 monospaced rendering of the data contents of the file, what is actually the case is that the feature
  differences between programming languages are rather miniscule compared to the open
  vista that a document format will provide.  The
  mainstream programming languages all currently exist within what characters .TXT accepts, but
  a document format will extend far beyond lines of monospaced, typewritten characters.
  A programming language can someday manifest as anything that involves
  a more graphical and interactive dynamic: it can include semiotical diagrams, images,
  multimedia, and a line of code can branch out into multiple lines.  Importantly,
  the organization of the information on the page will finally include graphic design
  layout, with a more compact and readable distribution of information, resulting in 
  far less scrolling.

 </p>

<p>To the graphic designer it is deeply problematic that computer code always
 looks like an undifferentiated mass of multi-colored ASCII keywords, something
  exotic-looking to the lay public but actually mundane.  
 When a code document, with markup underneath, is the medium, 
 the process of entering code might continue
  to emphasize typing out text characters but the end result, after 
  a given code keyword, command, or instruction is completed (not just “func” 
  but also “pop”, “push”, etc.), would be transformed in the code document 
  so that every keyword is provided its own unique symbol.   An 
  image variable referenced in the code will always have a symbol of an 
  image to its left (🖼️<b>imageVar<b>) .  The document would be far more 
  legible at a glance with this one change.  Every variable and object type 
  present in the code should have a symbol preceding its typewritten name so 
  that the page of code is legible at a glance.  
  Different sections of code should be colored by their categories,
  displaying distinctive font and styled box boundaries.
  This is the sort of priority a typical software engineering team wouldn’t normally take on and 
  it demonstrates the importance of emphasizing graphic design for the
  future of computer code and programming.

<h4>The Inclusion of External Physical Controls</h4>  

<p>Code editors and IDEs have remained largely the same in appearance
for decades, but now it makes sense for the programmer in the office to use hardware
to interact with the IDE and insert code, regarding the situation as
the same as how a video editor buys control decks.  At a minimum, Noctivagous suggests using
one or more touchscreen computers, such as an iPad, set up next to the programmer's
computer so that he or she can make use of a custom onscreen grid of 
buttons that insert common code snippets and templates for functions, classes,
loops, branching statements, variables of various types, etc.  

<h4>JIT-Focused Software Development</h4>
 <p>On another topic in software engineering, the work processes and what dynamic should be emphasized, it's 
  also important to note that many software applications today
  could be written in a live programming environment making use of JIT compilation, but for some
   reason this is only treated by the computing industry as relevant for a web app.  
   Many complex apps written for the web are fully ready for use as soon as "reload" is
   executed in a web browser, and this is in stark contrast to the inconvenience
   of compiling AOT (ahead-of-time compiled) code for equivalent 
   apps in desktop and mobile software development.  
   Something should be done to bring this JIT dynamic into mainstream software engineering
   as the central activity so that at least the software is developed in real time 
   but it can be compiled conventionally for optimization at the very end.
   For instance, a calendar software application is very lightweight for today's computers,
  and there is no reason that an application like that would need to
  be written in code that has to be recompiled after every change.  But the tools offered for
  web development, where live programming is most possible, are too undeveloped to replace
  conventional software engineering.  A calendar app is so lightweight
  that its code and user interface could be written and modified while it is opened, in a situation
  even better than reloading a web page.  
  The mindset of the software engineering community did not catch up
  with the major increase in computing processing power, the gains that were provided to JIT compilers
  as a result, and software applications today are written in a style that 
  is a holdover of the slower machines of the 1990s.  With web apps today, 
  they can be edited and then reloaded immediately, whereas the same app in an
   IDE may take 30 seconds or more to be recompiled.
  Of course, in the 1970s the original goal of Smalltalk-80 was to
  allow the programmer to edit the software in real time and that is what it could do.
  Other programming languages didn't adopt that feature, but now they can more easily than ever.
  For many types of apps, their functionality could
  be assembled and edited by the software engineer live because they
  only have certain functions that are processing intensive.  GUI is always
  lightweight for today's machines, but it wasn't for computers of the 1990s.
  That is why large software applications could be sketched out and filled in during an 
  execution mode.  Many professional apps could have their foundation assembled in
  real time.  Instead, any app has to be rebuilt (recompiled) unless it is a web app
  made out of JavaScript, because JIT code editing
  not been made a priority for mainstream software development.

 </p>

 <p>
 On another topic, the traditional UNIX command line interface also needs an upgrade
because when long sequences of logs and operations occur, they fly by so fast that 
they are completely unreadable, which often makes the situation absurd and pointless.  
Take for example that the command line, the line where commands are entered, is entirely
a vestige of the 1970s screens because it exist as part of the terminal output, 
displayed inside the overall grid of monospaced characters.  Since GUI is available, 
the command line can be separated from the output viewport and made its own
text area, which has been the case for CAD programs for a long time.  Then, what
is the terminal output area?  It no longer has to be confined to a VT100 emulation,
a grid of ASCII characters.  It can be redesigned to include graphics.
</p>

<p>
The command line should at least 
 be upgraded such that graphical progress bars appear inside the terminal window when 
 operations are taking place, and all terminal software should be graphics capable; 
 they should be able to show thumbnails of images inside the terminal window after 
 a command is executed, capable of showing them in a grid while listing a directory for example.
A terminal should be able to play videos too, even 5 at a time simultaneously.  
 Many aspects of the UNIX era should be upgraded.  Addressing the problem of a stream of 
 unreadable logs that quickly passes by: all log entires should declare their category or purpose so they 
 are grouped into boxes as they show up in the terminal.  Moreover, these boxes 
 should appear in multi-column format.

      Programming languages designed for application software development are more capable than a few decades
      ago, but not by much. Any progress has occurred inside the plain text file format.
      They haven't been upgraded in a comprehensive way that
      utilizes the new graphical capabilities of computers.  It's all terminal type.
      To give an illustrative example that adds to the two shown above, 
      an object variable should be assignable to an interactive vector field
      in the code editor.  A UI control embedded in a line of code can do much more than alphanumeric type
      in complex situations, across a wide range of subjects.  Instructions can someday be expressed semiotically, even,
      if graphics are embraced as elements inside a line of code.  So far, there has never been
      a semiotical programming language system.
      
      <p>
        When graphics are included, the resulting depth of command over the operations of a computer
      will not be matched by any current sequence of plain text.  Small experiments
      have shown that this is much superior,
      it's just that there are doubts expressed by some over whether it can match the
      speed of editing plain text&mdash; in other words the user interface. We address this here.  What seems like an insurmountable
      obstacle, making graphical code's interface comparable to plain text in editing power, is
      actually a matter of taking a different approach.  In every single case, previous attempts abandoned 
      too much of what was in active use in the practice of programming inside plain text and tried to come up with something foreign, which means
      that the code conventions did not match what people were trying to do when they program.
      Instead, Noctivagous' plan is to gradually add augmentations to plain text as it exists today.  A little bit
      later, code can break free from plain text and sit inside its own document file format.  (Already
      there are movements in this direction with Jupyter Notebook, just not for the code itself, only the output.)
      So, initially it is that UI and widgets additions are allowed inside a line of plain text code,
      just like right now when a color can be assigned to a color picker control. 
      After a color picker has been used in code for a while, it is felt as missing when not available. 
      In this way, graphical widgets and controls won't only be a matter of convenience.  When they
      are placed into code, they will be able to 
      summarize large sequences of computer instructions such that
      no one will want to go backwards to just typing out regular terminal type (monospaced type).
      <!--
          This is a path that makes sense because code's intricacies
      might be difficult to impose from the outside with an artificial scheme.

    -->

      <p>
        The importance of this effort can be explained in the following.
      Producing a competing web browser engine that is as
       complete as Chromium or WebKit can't be done in a short period
      of time, and when this isn't possible it represents a dead end for software
      development.  Those two software projects will never be unseated because
      there is little incentive to surpass them, as what is written from scratch 
      with current programming languages will
      basically end up being the same in outcome.  Even with AI programming
      assistants, this does not change because those engines have reached
      the ceiling of what plain text code will produce without an upgrade.
      
      </p>
      It is possible to escape this dead end and it is by breaking from
      the fusion of computer code to the typewriter.  For a major upgrade to happen,
      alterations like the above image have to occur, because code has to look more like
      the software it produces, not just raw, monospaced type.  It has to be able to express
      complex operations in terms of signs and symbol someday.
       Computer science mindsets that refuse collaboration with graphic design
       won't suffice, then, as software development has stayed inside terminal
       type all this time.
      When code is upgraded, the initial subjects of concern turn out to be different;
      they will have to incorporate graphic design and media design
      principles.  The areas of expertise involved are often outside of what is 
      found in mainstream software engineering discussions.
      
      <p>
      As explained in the articles on this page, the obstacle to a deeper level of
      progress in software development is the confining, primitive offerings of the 
      file format plain text, that it has been stretched far beyond
      its bare capabilities to serve increasingly large and complex needs, blowing past 
      the environment of 1980s and 1990s computing when it formed the programming languages
      still in active use today, like C++, Python, and Java.
      
      This primitive code medium is largely accidental, it doesn't lend itself to a surveyable view, 
      a zoomable map like CAD, and it of course by definition cannot accommodate rich text inside the code
      without odd adaptations.  Since it has so many limitations for today's world, it has to be
      transcended.
    
    <p>
      A collection like an array or 
      dictionary  is still not
      editable by way of a data table GUI control inside a line of code.  Instead, the programmer clumsily
      navigates through commas with the arrow keys.
      In addition to this, future computer code needs to be editable in multiple newspaper-like columns to
      make efficient use of screen space.  Plain text is too raw of a file format for programming software in the 21st century,
      and it doesn't allow inclusion of modern GUI controls for formulating groups of instructions. 
      
    </p>

    <p>Noctivagous starts with the plain text code 
      as programmers work with it today and then adds GUI to that as the first step, continuing
      the trend of exists today where the value of a color variable is controllable by an inline color picker.
      It is believed that later the code file should be transformed into a document file format 
      for truly rich code editing.   Each article below explains these issues.</p>
