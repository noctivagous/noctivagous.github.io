EXPANDING OPERATIONS AVAILABLE FOR MAKING
AND USING SELECTIONS

THE VAGUENESS OF THE MOUSE CLICK, ACTING AS OPENING
THINGS AND SELECTING THINGS COLLAPSED INTO ONE CLICK

On tablet, the keyboard keys mentioned below 
would correspond to buttons placed
on left edge touchscreen.

SELECT CLICKS COMBINED WITH ACTION(MODE)

Selections are usually tied to 
1) drag and drop  or
2) copy/cut to the pasteboard

But they can be sent elsewhere in another setup.
If, for example, a document and its cursor is
made the current target, the selection can be
copied there immediately without having to
use the paste function.

One or two presses does something
besides copy to clipboard.

Example 1: One at a time action.  

    Selection is in one-at-a-time mode (is not accumulative).
    
    Select a paragraph with the P key
    The second press of the P key places it
    in the scrapbook (or a document that is set as the target).

    Alternatively, it might take only one press of the P key
    to copy or move the paragraph to the scrapbook.
    Moving the paragraph would be the equivalent to cut and
    paste whereas copying the paragraph would be equivalent
    to copy and paste.
    

Example 2: Accumulative, Followed By Action Key

    1. Select paragraphs with the P key

    2. Press the T key to transfer the selection to the
    target document (or the scrapbook, if it is set
    as the target).
