One thing is for certain on computers
and that is referencing a file or directory should
not depend on having the right file path.
This is the cause of so many unnecessary errors.
When code projects are loaded by a code editor,
traversing what they contain should exist independent
of their file paths, with the project loading
everything as a whole into a database where every
element or object has a unique ID independent of
its file location.  If a variable is in one file
or another it is tracked by its hidden ID
and not its flat name.  This also happens
 on the file system when apps are working
 with files and documents. If a file is open, it should
be given a unique ID and then if it is
moved or changed on the file system, the app should
be notified.  This happens on Mac OS
But really the app shouldn't write to the file system 
or read from it but instead an intermediate database that doesn't
depend on file paths but instead contains a mass of
file/document IDs. That's because as far as a program is 
concerned, in effect but not formally stated, 
at any time a file or directory's path *is*
its ID, and the location of a variable inside
a file is that variable's ID.  The first step
for addressing that issue is to made code documents
out of a format like XML but even still those
documents, as part of a project, should reside in a 
database and be storied by unique IDs, even if it
is a unique string suffix appended to their
filenames.
This is also applicable to the web, because if
a document is made with a unique internal ID,
it won't matter that it isn't located in a certain
directory on the web server anymore, such as 
if it moved, because it will be referenced by its
unique id.  The web browser also follows the
pattern just described, that it in effect
treats a file or directory's file path as its ID
and then if that file path changes, it can't
be accessed anymore.  So, a new world wide web
would have to work differently and not tie
access of documents to their filesystem paths.
file system paths of documents change regularly,
so this is an absurd problem that is everywhere
in computing.
