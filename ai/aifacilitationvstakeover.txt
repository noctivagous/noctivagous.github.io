AI Facilitation of Work Processes Vs. AI Takeover of Human Jobs

Discussing What Constitutes Proper Pursuit of AI Technology, Using The Example of a Vegetable-Cutting Appliance That Is Driven by AI

A vegetable-cutting appliance for the kitchen that will cut or dice any vegetable placed inside its box would be of immense value to the cook.  This type of device would have been challenging to construct before recent advances in AI, as the machine has to be able to recognize every type of vegetable placed inside it and, on its own, know how to peel or cut accurately with its cutting equipment. Many aspects of this are achievable in a straightforward way by training a neural network. Whether it is the recognition of the vegetables or how they are to be cut, a neural network would be trained for the device to process all common fruits and vegetables.

We can use this hypothetical device to explain how technologists should view AI more often, which is to solve individual problems as they currently exist inside the activity rather than replace the entirety of a human activity.  A full-sized home cook robot won't be affordable for a long time and it will require lots of testing to consistently perform each cooking stage.   A vegetable-cutting device is already known to be achievable as a consumer product and it would be utilizable in some initial form in a few years.  The dimensions of this appliance would be comparable to a large microwave, with a price that is closer to affordable for the consumer. It would be usable by anyone for convenient, at-home cooking, including people who rarely cook today but might just want to put a chopped tomato on a salad. Unlike products that place AI in the kitchen for the heating stage of cooking, a category that is already quite satisfied without the inclusion of AI functionality, the purpose of this appliance is for a less glamorous stage of preparing food: the cutting and peeling of vegetables.  It would be harder to put this appliance together for every type of vegetable without AI, unlike the cooking appliances that currently perform well for cooking without it.  So the gains from adding AI to them will be far less than constructing this.

An appliance with this goal would take the world by storm, it would be driven by AI, but it would not be a robot doing everything to make a meal. It's a category of kitchen appliance that may appear arbitrary to those who are unfamiliar with home cooking. But many others, who cook regularly and also manage other responsibilities, know that cutting vegetables is frequently an involved process, even if the person has no objections to doing it as a chore.  Whatever is happening in life comes to an abrupt halt and becomes tedious vegetable peeling and cutting.  Nowadays, the food preparation stage is more in need of being addressed by a kitchen appliance than the other various types of cooking, as air fryers and pressure cookers are now well-established and working well for everyone.  The microwave is now basically indispensable to modern life. 

As for whether this is a feasible use of AI, this device surely could be engineered to cut just about anything placed into it in a few minutes when there has been so much development for food processing in industrial settings.  On a related topic, for decades there has been the home food processor in the kitchen with its spinning blade, but this serves primarily to produce quantity.  It also requires that the vegetables are peeled and cut into pieces in advance, so it isn't solving the problem we are discussing.  Our device would provide the convenience of a microwave but for cutting vegetables— put a vegetable or two inside and out comes a chopped result.  It would not necessarily focus on quantity to begin with but instead addressing the chore itself.

When the vegetables are taken out of this AI-driven kitchen device they will be ready for cooking or assembling for cold dishes, such as fruit salads.  A potato placed inside can become the basis of fries or chips.  The machine also cuts up the scraps and places them to the side of the cut vegetables for easy composting, and because of this the device does not need to dispose of anything through a plumbing attachment and it is self-contained.  It would just have a cleaning mode after being provided soap and water, also executed by AI.  All of this would be far-fetched in a time before recent advances in AI.  But a larger point is that the device does not attempt to take over the entire process of cooking, pushing the human out of the kitchen.  It instead directly addresses an issue that cooks encounter: vegetable cutting is the main obstacle to regular cooking at home, because even if people enjoy doing it or they don't mind the chore, it creates a hassle that cannot be easily overcome at all times. Professional chefs are not the workers in the restaurant kitchen cutting vegetables, either, so of course this could reduce costs in other industries.  The extra work that vegetable cutting creates for cleanup often takes too much time for a home cook to balance other chores, but at times a bowl of two chopped tomatoes might be all that is needed.

Following the conventional mentality and approach for making a kitchen appliance that incorporates AI for cooking, it will be an expensive robot that has moving arms (moving around outside of a contained appliance box) and it will be able to cook on a stove what it cuts too, perhaps roaming around the stove and kitchen on a track. Apart from requiring far more engineering and AI technology than can be affordable for the average consumer today, this robot setup is unlikely to be manufactured for the consumer within a normal timeframe, and it will be an experimental product for a long time, limited to restaurants, some of whom might not even want such a robot until it is well-established.  The size of the device will be large, it will take up a lot of space, the assembly will likely require a professional's assistance, safety may be an issue with its large rotating parts and arms, and it will not necessarily fit in an average household kitchen. It may not be considered worth it by most homeowners for a long time, just to have an extra cook, because of all the downsides. Thus this second approach, this takeover of the whole process by making a partial humanoid that roams across the kitchen, takes a lot more development time and engineering resources and is an inferior way to utilize AI in a kitchen appliance for our times-- if we want AI to be of use to us in the near future for real life. Similarly, self-driving cars were supposed to take over the entire driving trip but still the benefits are questionable and limited to luxury cars.  After a period of intense hype and competition and billions of dollars poured into the self-driving car industry from all kinds of investors, including Google and Tesla, these still are not ready for the mainstream.  A chef robot would take a similar research track.  Ialso stirs a person inside, as the entire cooking activity has been taken over completely-- supposedly for the purpose of making everyday life easier. Though it makes life easier in that way, it doesn't have to do that, as we just demonstrated, because only one part of the cooking process is currently causing significant obstacles for people at home.  The approach of what to use AI for matters: the chef robot may not solve problems for regular people whereas the vegetable-cutting appliance certainly will.

The goal of an AI device should not be to make life easy, to replace an activity to the point that no human effort has to be expended, but instead fix aspects of existing processes that carry complicated aspects, especially those that are causing problems because they are missing pieces to their puzzle.  For home cooking, it's the vegetable cutting stage that needs to be made a cinch and then everything else will fall into place.  In the same way, there are indications to the outside observer that there are only a few aspects of making a road that would need to be addressed by an AI machine, and in the same way this machine would immediately make road construction faster and more affordable, just like the vegetable-cutting appliance.  In the case of road construction, it might be the laying down of road material that can be done by the AI because of the precision and consistency that it can provide at this stage, reducing the fatigue impacting workers for the other stages. The AI community would start its road construction product by trying to do everything from start to finish, with a very large machine, and it would remove all workers from the situation as a goal. Instead, it is almost certain that many more workers could be kept while being provided one or more AI-driven machines that take care of the hassles of specific stages that are causing  unnecessary delays and wear on the workers.  This is the discussion of AI's complete takeover of an entire task versus AI's facilitation of certain stages of the work process. AI takeover is undesirable and is the mindset at AI companies, whereas AI facilitation is basically an absent topic of discussion. Devices made for AI facilitation can exist today, delivered on schedule like the vegetable-cutting machine, whereas takeover AI, like self-driving cars, will always take a long time and involves long-term issues of speculation.  Self-driving cars were supposed to be driving many people around by now with AI (a regularly stated prediction around 2016), at least from the airport and back. Takeover AI machines make lots of promises that cannot be guaranteed to be fulfilled on time, because too much is taken on by the engineering research and the machine. Though AGI (artificial general intelligence) is something some people want that supposedly would solve many issues mentioned, it is not available, experts vary in their predictions on when it would appear, and that is what should be the topic of discussion.

To all drivers road construction is notoriously slow, but if AI is supposed to do it all in a single machine we may find ourselves in the same situation as self-driving cars, which still bring with them a lot of unsolved problems and remaining ethical concerns.  No one should shy away from what matters in the short-term, in other words. This can benefit humanity more today compared to those oversized undertakings.  It would be beneficial right now to produce devices that assist road construction for individual problems that make the work take too much time.

In the case of the vegetable-cutting appliance that can sit next to the microwave, the barrier to AI providing something helpful is extremely low compared to what is extremely high: a big, expensive robot requiring complicated assembly screwed into the wall or placed on a track that roams across the kitchen. The purpose of AI has not been confined by the single purpose of a vegetable-cutting device but rather directed into a more rational objective, to deal with what has been identified as inadequate for people's process in life as it is lived today. This is an AI philosophy that does not aim do it all for people, such as to write the entire paper, to make the entire illustration for them, to prepare and cook the entire meal from a predefined setting, to make every aspect of the entire road, to drive the car from point A to B without a person touching the steering wheel.  The consequence is that the outcome will be higher quality, feasible, and controllable.

This involves going through the effort to identify what is missing first, though. What is the obstacle in a given activity, such as how the task of home cooking is psychologically and practically hindered by the friction of having to peel and cut vegetables and then clean up the scraps afterwards. By comparison, the current intentions of AI research are limited, as they aren't willing to examine what is wrong in any given situation, just make a one-size-fits all AI megamachine that is trained on everything and that takes over everything that people do in the job. What follows is a job that is too big for AI engineering, which is a machine that has to do everything for something and also needs hardware engineering to match.  When it is recognized this is too big of a job, then it becomes a matter of speculation, that there will be AGI (artificial general intelligence) that will server as a kind of panacea for all of the domestic life issues people have, which is not a certainty.

Of course in theory a multipurpose personal domestic robot would take care of everything from house cleaning to cooking, but in practice that will be expensive for a long time and will not appear as a finished consumer product for many years to come given the current state of physical technology.  So the first goal is to recognize that there exists this excessive optimism in the tech industry which can never deliver such products like self-driving cars on time (is that really a worthwhile goal in the first place?) and admit that for AI to truly serve people it has to be applied to existing situations such that it lubricates the gears of life, not takes by force entire jobs of everyday life. If something helpful makes people uncomfortable, it is following the wrong track.

Had ChatGPT existed for one purpose, to write code, and OpenAI centered its efforts around that it would do the job much better than today. Though it is remarkable in how it is able to write code, and the quality is often high, there are often errors anyway. When the devices are too broad in purpose there results a lack of clarity, for something like ChatGPT, because it takes a lot of effort to figure out how to use it for anything, even though it can do a lot and is very useful for many tasks. On the surface it would exist to write papers for people from start to finish so that they don't have to do anything, or write entire computer programs for them from start to finish that compile. That is at first glance what its purpose would be for many chores. What is ChatGPT for though? Lots of things like that with some major exceptions added to the mix. It will be a long time before code is directly compiled into finished programs from AI without error, and in the first place it would then be a new culture of AI-directed app programming (much like today) instead of truly replacing regular programming. The AI companies say that the GPT is a tool for all kinds of tasks, as long as you can figure out what they are and how to get it to do them. That doesn't sound so great when re-examined. It certainly can serve quite capably and much of the output is remarkable, but that wasn't really how the ChatGPT was set up, so there is a misalignment of stated product goals and the form that the product takes, which is open-ended and places the burden of using it on the consumer.
