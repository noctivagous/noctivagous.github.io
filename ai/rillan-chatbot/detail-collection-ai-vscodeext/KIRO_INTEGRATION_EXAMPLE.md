# Kiro Integration Example

## How to Use Rillan AI Workflow Interface with Kiro

### Step 1: Generate Detailed Specifications

1. **Open VS Code** with your project
2. **Install the Extension** (F5 in development mode)
3. **Run Command**: `Cmd+Shift+P` ‚Üí "Start Detail Collection"
4. **Enter Request**: "Build a task management web app"

### Step 2: System Analysis

The extension will analyze your request and show:
```
Project Analysis:
- Type: Web Application
- Complexity: Medium
- Suggested Approach: Full-stack development with modern framework
```

### Step 3: Fill Out Dynamic Form

The system generates a contextual form with sections like:
- **Project Overview**: Name, description, goals
- **Technical Requirements**: Framework, database, hosting
- **Features**: Core functionality, user management, integrations
- **UI/UX**: Design preferences, responsive requirements
- **Timeline**: Milestones, deadlines, priorities

### Step 4: Export Structured Data

The extension saves a JSON file to `.rillan-ai/rillan-ai-details-[timestamp].json`:

```json
{
  "formId": "web-app-20250829-143022",
  "timestamp": "2025-08-29T14:30:22.123Z",
  "projectType": "web",
  "complexity": "medium",
  "details": {
    "projectName": "TaskFlow Pro",
    "description": "A modern task management web application",
    "framework": "React with TypeScript",
    "database": "PostgreSQL",
    "features": [
      "User authentication",
      "Task creation and management",
      "Team collaboration",
      "Real-time notifications"
    ],
    "designStyle": "Modern, clean interface",
    "timeline": "3 months",
    "priority": "MVP first, then advanced features"
  }
}
```

### Step 5: Use with Kiro

Copy the JSON content and use it with Kiro:

```
Hey Kiro, I've used the Rillan AI Workflow Interface to gather comprehensive requirements for my project. Here's the structured specification:

[Paste JSON content here]

Based on these detailed requirements, please help me:
1. Create the project structure
2. Set up the development environment
3. Build the core features step by step

The specification includes all the context you need - no more back-and-forth questions!
```

### Benefits

‚úÖ **No More Vague Requests**: Instead of "build an app", you provide complete specifications
‚úÖ **Faster AI Responses**: Kiro has all context upfront
‚úÖ **Better Results**: Structured data leads to more accurate implementations
‚úÖ **Consistent Process**: Repeatable workflow for all projects
‚úÖ **Time Savings**: Less iteration, more focused development
