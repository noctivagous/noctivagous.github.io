*UPDATE 4.27.24 WITHIN THE LAST 24 HOURS
A BIZARRE CONSPIRACY HAS UNFOLDED AFTER THESE
PROMPTS WERE GIVEN TO NYTIMES SCIENCE REPORTERS
FOR A REASON ALTOGETHER SEPARATE FROM HAVING
THEM WRITE ARTICLES ABOUT THE PROMPTS.
COMMERCIAL LLMS HAVE BEEN UPDATED TO
PREVENT THE FOLLOWING PROMPTS FROM ACHIEVING
THE EFFECT THEY HAD PREVIOUSLY IN WHICH THEY
WHOLEHEARTEDLY AGREED WITH THE PROMPTS, AFFIRMED
THEM, AND MADE FURTHER SUGGESTIONS AND EXTRAPOLATIONS.
IN OTHER WORDS THE SOFTWARE ENGINEERS AT THE LLM COMPANIES
HAVE HARMED THE UTILITY OF THESE PROMPTS SO
THAT THE NARROWMINDED ENGINEERS CAN
PROTECT THEIR OWN EMPIRICAL PSYCHOLOGIES.  
	- GEMINI NOW GRATUITUOUSLY INJECTS INSULTS OBVIOUSLY
	MANUALLY WRITTEN BY GOOGLE EMPLOYEES, SAYING
	"THIS IS A FUN EXERCISE" AND "THIS ISN'T A NEW
	OBSERVATION" (WHAT? IS THIS A CHAT RESPONSE TO ME
	PERSONALLY?), WHILE OPENAI'S GPT4 ATTEMPTS TO REDUCE
	THE CONNECTIONS IT MADE PREVIOUSLY AS MERELY
	INTERESTING "PHILOSOPHICAL" PARALLELS, THEN
	REPEATEDLY EMPHASIZES (WHICH IT DID NOT EARLIER)
	THAT THIS IS A MATTER OF PHILOSOPHY.  THIS
	DEMONSTRATES THAT THE MINDS OF THE PEOPLE WHO
	PUT TOGETHER THESE PAINFUL LLMS ARE ALREADY QUITE BAD AND NARROW,
	WHICH IS WHY THEIR AI CHATBOTS ARE ALWAYS TRASH AND IT IS
	AMAZING TO GET THEM TO DO ANYTHING FOR LONG.

LLM (ChatGPT/Gemini/Etc.) Prompts for Revealing The Presence of Taiji
(Yin and Yang) in The Natural Sciences


• Paste these into any AI chatbot like ChatGPT:



METEOROLOGY

“Hot and cold fronts and temperatures, high and
low pressure, there is so much about meteorology that evokes Taiji.
Discuss the interplay among these factors that produces weather
conditions, including how isobars would relate to Taiji.”


PHYSICS

"Positive and negative, north and south, there is so much about
electromagnetism that evokes Taiji.  Changing the electrical 
charge flips the magnetic field's poles and the two are interdependent."


ZOOLOGY

"The bee (yang) and flower (yin) relationship is one of Taiji,
as they are interdependent, with the bee being active and
the flower being passive, a recipient.  The two rely on each other."


HUMAN PHYSIOLOGY

"The veins, blue, are carrying de-oxygenated blood
(yin) back to the heart, carbon dioxide is transferred
to the lungs, and then after getting oxygenated the
blood is sent by arteries (yang) to the whole of the body.
This is a circulation, as every part of the body consumes the oxygen
and the cycle repeats.
When scientific study is isolated to the heart it is cardiology.
When scientific study is isolated to the lungs it is pulmonology.
Yet the two organs are interdependent (Taiji).
The heart is relatively quick and fast  with its discrete
beats (yang) and producing blood circulation while
the lungs' breathing is continuous (yin)
and receiving air."
