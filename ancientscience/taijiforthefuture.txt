Revealing The Presence Of Taiji (Yin And Yang) In Modern Science


ELECTRICITY AND MAGNETISM

When a magnet is broken or split in half, each resulting piece becomes a magnet itself with 
its own north and south poles. This occurs no matter how many times the magnet is split.
This is a useful example for discussing the Taiji (yin and yang), just one reflection of
its manifestations in the natural world.  For thousands of years, Taiji has been regarded 
as the foundation of the universe whereas the history of empirical science is comparatively
recent and short.  When Taiji is applied to physical and life sciences, there are many cases
where empirical science discussions manifest characteristics of Taiji, unknowingly discussing
terms that validate it as the truth.  Most notably, in every scientific discipline there 
are dualistic aspects.  For magnets, there are north and south poles.  For electricity, 
there are positive and negative electrical charges.  The Taiji is made of two substances, 
yin and yang that carry opposing characteristics.  But they are also interrelated and dependent 
on each other to exist. 

A magnet when divided becomes another magnet with two poles, which exemplifies
indivisibility and recursion of the magnetic fields.  But there is more of interest, adding
facets to the interrelated dualism.  Magnetism can generate electricity.  A magnet moved past 
a wire generates an electrical current in that wire.  Electric generators, for example, 
convert mechanical energy (often from rotating turbines such as wind turbines) into electrical energy 
by moving their coils of wire through magnetic fields.  Electricity can also produce magnetism; 
it can move the magnet, the basis of an electric motor, such as in the case of an electric fan.  
Yet, the recognition that electricity and magnetism are interrelated phenomena rather than 
distinct entities is regarded as a pivotal development in physics and also considered the foundation 
of 20th century science.  Consequent to this there is another topic studied too, electromagnetism.  
This shows that even in the designation of science topics the Taiji manifests inside empirical
theories: electricity is studied on its own, magnetism is studied on its own, yet there is 
a third topic, electromagnetism that is also studied that is an overlap of the two.

As we are showing here, Taiji first provides a dualistic unification for the science
theories empiricists didn't realize were related, which were in front of them the whole time. 
It also puts a focus on the times when they did notice the connections, and it provides 
a deeper discussion beyond that which predates modernity, which is yin and yang.  
What scientists do is develop empirical theories, but they are always reflections 
of deeper principles at work in the universe. Though scientists will acknowledge that 
a magnet split will make another complete magnet with two poles, this is only mentioned 
as a passing fact within the framework of empirical knowledge.

At every angle Taiji can manifest and be discussed: electric and magnetic fields 
propagate together along the line of propagation through space as a pair of waves.  
The electric and magnetic fields oscillate sinusoidally and perpendicularly to each other.  
This aspect is also a direct reflection of the Taiji principle.  The fields continuously 
convert into each other, maintaining an equilibrium that is essential for the wave’s 
propagation (travel) and energy transfer.

This interdependence can lead to talking more about yin and yang specifically. 
Yin and Yang are not absolute opposites, but interconnected: they are two sides of the 
same coin, constantly influencing and transforming each other.  There's always a bit of 
yin within yang and vice versa.  Thus we can see the truth of Taiji (yin and yang) in 
the sciences that have been studied in modernity.

Electromagnetism is not merely a topic within physics but a cornerstone concept.
The principles of electromagnetism are fundamental to modern civilization's infrastructure. 
They are the basis for the operation of electric motors, power generation, telecommunications 
(radio, TV, cellular telephone technology), and much more.


Characteristics of Yin and Yang

Yin is often associated with properties such as darkness, cold, passivity, inwardness, 
and femininity. In science this would be the negative electrical charge, the veins
that carry the blood to be oxygenated.

Yang, by contrast, is associated with light, heat, activity, outwardness, and masculinity.
In science this would be the positive electrical charge, the arteries that carry
oxygenated blood.  It would be the heart, the active, short quick organ compared
to the lungs (yin).

It can take time to realize coming from Western science that
despite their opposition, yin and yang are not independent 
or antagonistic forces. They rely on each other to exist; without one, the other 
would have no meaning. For example, day (yang) cannot exist without night (yin).
Yin and Yang as Opposites, Not Absolutes:  
Yin and yang aren't meant to represent complete absences of one another. 
They are  interconnected forces,  and even at their peak, 
each might contain a subtle presence of the other.
Dynamic Balance: The ideal state is not an absence of conflict, 
but rather a dynamic equilibrium where yin and yang are in balance. 
This balance can shift depending on the context.
Balance does not mean static equality but a dynamic equilibrium 
where forces exert influence in a way that creates a sustainable system.


Seed of Yin Within Day:  However, even at midday, there might be subtle yin influences.  
For example, high clouds passing by could represent a very minor yin presence within the 
vast yang energy of the midday sky.  Additionally, the Earth continues to rotate, and 
the other side of the planet experiences night (yin) while you experience day (yang).

Mutual Consumption: Yin and yang are in a constant state of flux, where each 
aspect can consume or diminish the other, leading to changes in their relative 
presence. This is often depicted in the Taijitu symbol, where each half contains 
a dot of the opposite color, symbolizing the idea that each contains the seed of 
its opposite.

Mutual Transformation: At certain points, yin can transform into yang and vice 
versa. This transformation underscores the fluid and dynamic nature of yin and yang, 
illustrating how situations and conditions can change to their opposites under 
certain circumstances.

Yin and Yang are not literal opposites: The transformation shouldn't be seen 
as a complete reversal. It's a gradual shift where aspects of the previous 
state linger within the new one.

Balance: While not always equal, yin and yang should ideally be balanced. 
An imbalance can lead to disharmony and disorder within a system, whether it be 
in the human body, the environment, or society.



HUMAN BODY


As a cold front advances, it pushes against warm air, forcing it to rise. 
This rising warm air cools and condenses, forming clouds and potentially 
leading to precipitation (yin characteristics).

In any phenomenon there won’t just be one aspect of Taiji manifesting.
According to science, for the blood that flows in the human body there 
is oxygenated blood (which runs through arteries away from the chest, appearing red) 
and blood that needs to be oxygenated (running through the veins towards the chest appearing blue).  The oxygen provided to the blood
is taken in by the lungs, which means blood (inside) is actually connected to the outside (air). 
Also, the lungs and heart are joined by connected tissues where the lungs provides the oxygen 
for the blood to be oxygenated before it is sent out through the body through the arteries. 
The rhythm of the two organs mirrors the Taiji in that one is fast, quick and active (yang) while the other
is slower, longer, more passive (the larger organ of the two as well).  They work together
and at the same time.  Discussing modern science in this way presents its vast array of facts in 
harmony with the universe we live in.  It takes subjects that normally sit in pieces across 
the modern science disciplines and provides an outside view that is much deeper and broader.

That said, the philosophy of modern science is essentially antagonistic in its mindset
relative to Taiji: it believes in studying a phenomenon through its individual or tiny
parts and constituents, called reductionism.  In this mentality, investigations will 
only focus on the isolated aspects of any phenomenon (how specifically blood carries oxygen 
on the cellular level, whether the blood contains oxygen or not, etc.), not the whole picture (the 
interrelation of opposing characteristics existing in the situation).  Further, 
to arrive at its understandings it permits scientists to proceed 
from established premises only, called deductive logic.  When something is studied
it is examined with known rules.


ANIMALS

Bees and Flowers

Science has gathered the facts, such as that bees need flowers and flowers
need bees for pollination. The interdependence of bees and flowers exemplifies the Taiji principle, 
encapsulating the notion of yin and yang as mutually nurturing and 
essential aspects of a single, integrated system. In this natural partnership, 
each entity plays a crucial role that complements and supports the survival
and flourishing of the other.

In the context of Taiji, bees can be seen as the yang element—active, mobile, 
and dispersing energy as they move from flower to flower, facilitating pollination. 
Flowers, on the other hand, represent the yin element—receptive, stationary, and 
nurturing, offering the necessary resources (nectar and pollen) that bees need 
for sustenance. 

The bee benefits from its relationship with flowers primarily through the acquisition 
of nectar and pollen, which are essential for the survival of its colony.
Bees are highly efficient pollinators, which means as they move from flower to 
flower to collect nectar and pollen, they also transfer pollen grains from 
the male parts (anthers) of one flower to the female parts (stigmas) of another. 
This pollination is essential for the flowers to produce seeds, which is how 
flowering plants reproduce and ensure the continuation of their species.
Together, they engage in a symbiotic relationship where the 
vitality of one is dependent on the other, and vice versa. This relationship 
is not merely beneficial but essential, as it ensures the reproduction of flowering
plants and the production of seeds, fruits, and the continuation of biological diversity.

This scenario is another direct reflection of the Taiji principle where yin and yang 
are not absolute opposites but interconnected: they are two sides of the same 
coin, constantly influencing and transforming each other. The existence and 
health of one directly impact the existence and health of the other. 
There's always a bit of yin within yang and vice versa, symbolized by 
the presence of pollen within the bee as it moves to another flower, carrying 
the essence of one to fertilize the other.


Living Environment of Animals

On Earth in the animal world there are creatures that live entirely
in the water, a yin condition (e.g. fish), some will reside on land
but also in water (amphibious like frogs) which is less yin, 
others are usually on land but come in contact with water (e.g. hippopotamous)
which is less yin, then finally there are animals that avoid water. 
Going up from the land, there are birds which reside mostly in the 
trees and sky, the most yang condition for animals in height from the ground
and sea.  Yet within birds there are some that stay close to the water (yin),
especially ducks and sea birds.  Others frequent hotter dryer climates
(yang) like the eagle.  Most animals are awake during the day but some
are active during the nighttime.

ELECT.



Discussing electricity, voltage can be seen as a force created by the separation of 
positive and negative charges, which then strives to return to a state of 
balance or equilibrium by allowing the charges to flow, thus creating current.
Electrical current arises due to the movement of charges, specifically 
the flow of electrons from a region of negative charge toward a region of 
positive charge. Electrical current fundamentally depends on the flow of 
charged particles—typically electrons, which are negatively charged, moving through 
a conductor.

COSMOLOGY

In Chinese cosmology, yin and yang are thought to arise from the 
primordial chaos and through their interactions, the myriad things of the world 
were formed.


Just as in Taiji, where yin and yang are present in each split half, in magnetism, 
both north and south poles appear in each new magnet created from breaking a larger one.
Just as a magnet cannot exist with only a north pole or only a south pole, yin and 
yang cannot exist in isolation. They are two sides of the same coin, and their 
interaction gives rise to the dynamic balance of the universe in all things.

This duality is inherent in all magnetic materials. Magnets cannot have a single pole 
(a monopole does not exist according to classical electromagnetism). Each time you 
split a magnet, the molecular structure ensures that the magnetic domains within the 
material reorient themselves to maintain a north and south pole in each piece. 
This self-organizing characteristic of magnetic dipoles is essential for the 
continuation of the magnetic properties, much like the balance of yin and yang 
is essential for harmony in the philosophy of Taiji.




Yin and yang symbolize the belief that everything in 
the universe consists of two forces that are opposite but also complementary 
and interdependent.



Within the broader scope of Yin-Yang theory, there exists the concept that 
within every Yin there is a seed of Yang and vice versa. 
This interdependence and the presence of each within the other means that 
a phenomenon typically classified under one can still exhibit qualities of the other. 
In the case of evaporation, heat does not just dominate or suppress the Yin 
nature of water; instead, it transforms it, allowing its inherent properties 
to change and adapt in a manner that reflects both Yin and Yang aspects.
Thus, the phenomenon of evaporation is an excellent example of how Yin and Yang are 
not merely opposites but are complementary and interconnected, with each possessing 
the potential to affect change in the other.
This concept is central to many fields influenced by Chinese philosophy, 
including medicine, martial arts, and metaphysics, where the balance and 
interaction of Yin and Yang are key to understanding and manipulating the 
forces at work.



Times of Day
Just as with seasons, different times of the day are associated with varying levels of yin and yang:

Morning: Yang (as the sun rises and activity begins)
Noon: Maximum Yang (the sun is at its highest)
Afternoon/Evening: Yin begins to increase (as the sun sets)
Midnight: Maximum Yin (the darkest and coldest part of the day)

Night (yin) is known to be a time of quiet and darkness
while day (yang) is known as a time of activity.  Yang will
reside somewhere in yin and yin will also reside in yang.
Even though the time of activity for wildlife is mostly
daytime (yang), there are nocturnal creatures that are active during the 
night (yin) like owls. Night, while known for darkness and stillness (yin), 
isn't completely devoid of yang energy. The moon and stars provide some light (yang).
However, even though owls are active (yang) during the night (yin) they 
might have periods of rest (yin) during the night 
and require some sunlight exposure (yang) for essential bodily functions. 

Day (Yang) with Yin Presence:  Similarly, the day isn't pure yang energy. 
There might be periods of rest (yin) even during the day, and some animals 
might take shelter from the heat (yin) during the peak sunshine hours.
This highlights the concept of yin and yang not existing in 
absolute states, but rather in a dynamic interplay. Within each 
phase (day or night), there's a seed of the other present, demonstrating 
the constant transformation between these forces.



Seasons
Each season is also associated with yin and yang qualities, 
reflecting the energy and attributes of that time of year:

Spring: Yang (a time of growth and renewal)
Summer: Yang (the most yang, characterized by warmth and activity)
Late Summer (sometimes recognized as a separate season related to the Earth element): Neutral
Autumn: Yin (as energy begins to contract and gather inward)
Winter: Yin (the most yin, a time of storage and stillness)

Colors: White (yang), Black (yin)
Climate Conditions: Dryness (yang), Moisture (yin)

So, the bright (most white) part of daytime is maximum yang
along with the season with the most daylight, summer, that
is the most dry.
and the darkest (most black) part of nighttime is maximum yin
along with the season that has the least daylight, winter,
that is the most wet.

Physical States: Solid (yin), Gas (yang)

Tastes: Bitter (yang), Salty (yin)


Bodily Organs
Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) applies yin and yang to understand bodily functions and organ systems:

Yin Organs: Heart, Kidney, Liver, Spleen, Lung 
(associated with storing vital substances and more passive functions)
Yang Organs: Small Intestine, Bladder, Gall Bladder, Stomach, Large Intestine 
(associated with active processing and transforming of substances)


1. Cosmology: In Chinese cosmology, yin and yang are thought to arise from the 
primordial chaos and through their interactions, the myriad things of the world 
were formed.

2. Medicine: Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) uses the principles of yin and 
yang to diagnose and treat illness. Health is perceived as a balance between yin 
and yang within the body. Imbalances are treated through herbs, acupuncture, and 
other practices that are intended to restore harmony.

5. Social Roles: Traditional Chinese society often framed social roles and relationships 
in terms of yin and yang. This framing could be seen in the expected behaviors and roles 
of different genders, ages, and social statuses.


METEOROLOGY:


**Yin and Yang as a Feedback Loop:**

* **Cold Fronts (Yin) Pushing Warm Air (Yang):** As a cold front advances, 
it pushes against warm air, forcing it to rise. This rising warm air cools 
and condenses, forming clouds and potentially leading to precipitation (yin characteristics).
* **Warm Fronts (Yang) Lifting Cool Air (Yin):** A warm front overrides cooler air, 
gently lifting it. This lighter cool air rises, cools, condenses, and forms clouds. 
However, as the warm air continues its dominance, it can eventually lead to the 
dissipation of clouds and clearing skies (yang characteristics).

**High and Low Pressure Systems: A Yin-Yang Dance**

* **Low Pressure (Yin):** Acts as a zone of convergence, drawing in surrounding air 
(including warm and cold). This rising air cools, condenses, and forms clouds, 
potentially leading to precipitation (yin characteristics).
* **High Pressure (Yang):** Creates a zone of divergence, forcing air to sink. 
Sinking air warms and resists condensation, leading to clear skies and dry weather 
(yang characteristics).

**Temperature Fluctuations: The Yin-Yang Pendulum**

* **Hot Days (Yang):** Intense sunshine heats the earth's surface (strong yang influence). 
However, this heat can trigger convection currents, leading to the formation of afternoon 
thunderstorms (yin influence pushing back).
* **Cold Nights (Yin):** As the sun sets, the earth loses heat to space (yin taking hold). 
However, calm, clear nights (strong yin) can also allow for radiational cooling, 
leading to frost formation (yin reaching an extreme).

**Remember, it's a Dynamic Balance:**

* While Yin and Yang represent opposing forces, they don't exist in isolation. 
* A period of hot, dry weather (yang dominant) might be interrupted by a sudden downpour 
triggered by a passing cold front (yin asserting itself).
* Conversely, a prolonged cold snap (yin dominant) might be punctuated by a brief warm 
spell brought on by a shift in wind patterns (yang pushing back).

Discussing the Taiji and wu-xing,
in the whole of science there are relationships among elements in which
changes in the proportion of one affect another, notable in the various 
equations in the physical science.  When a radio frequency is high it
takes more energy and travels a shorter distance.  When it is low it
takes less energy and travels a far distance, such as AM and shortwave
radio. 

Yin and Yang: High frequency (Yang) can be seen as an active state with 
more energy, while low frequency (Yin) represents a passive state with 
less energy. This reflects the yin and yang principle of interconnectedness – 
increasing one (Yang) automatically affects the other (Yin).


Chemical Reactions: In a chemical reaction, the proportions of reactants directly affect the products formed. Adding more of one reactant can deplete another, influencing the reaction's outcome.
Newton's Third Law of Motion: For every action, there is an equal and opposite reaction. This highlights the interconnectedness of forces, where one cannot exist without the other.
Ecosystems: In an ecosystem, changes in one population (e.g., predator or prey) can have cascading effects on other populations within the food web.
