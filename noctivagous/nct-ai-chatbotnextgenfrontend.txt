The next generation of AI chatbot front-end should be our focus. To begin with, we can recognize the concept of putting the AI chatbot into modes, such as step-by-step walkthrough (a step–result–interpret loop), with the GUI of the app changing (there being different app layouts) to match each mode.  A step-by-step walkthrough mode applies to troubleshooting a computer, an appliance, etc., and presents tasks on slides, one at a time, with a large text box to the side for the user to insert results.  This is unlike static decision trees because it will be generating the tasks dynamically in response to the results entered by the user for each step.  A complex 3D modeling software package can be learned this way. Another mode would be a teaching mode for course instruction, and the GUI would change to accommodate that.  Other modes include one that gathers information in the form of questionnaires before taking action, such as to set up a software development project or any type of project that where there are placeholder aspects that have to be filled in.    These modes can be programmed and supplied by users in the form of files that have a sequence and flow descriptor (declarative) data format, which describes which GUI to use for a mode.  By doing all of this, the AI chatbot of today, which has remained the same since 2022, can go beyond a one-size-fits-all GUI. 

It's also the case that if given a set of workflow components and GUI controls, the AI could put together its own GUI forms and sequences for any situation. At the same tim, though, a stock set of modes will provide known usage of the AI and consistency.

To simulate a walkthrough mode in today's AI chatbot, give it the following prompt: "I want to ____.  Let's do this one step at a time and I give you results. A step–result–interpret loop."

If this AI app is running on the desktop, it can be given an AI agent with read-only program execution privileges that allow it to execute apps and open up windows, which would allow it to make an on-the-fly orientation for any user to a system like Linux or an app that is unfamiliar.

In the future, it could be the case that the AI is given a set of complete application kit components and wires up its own apps on the fly.
