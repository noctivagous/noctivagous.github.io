nct-desktop-applaunchmenus

Instead of just launching the app,
you open the app's launch menu
which has actions that command
the app after it is finished opening.
This is because after a user opens
an app he then does something with it.
Instead the user can enter the app
with the command.

For a web browser:

- Search the web: [______]  (the user can search from this launch menu)

    - After the web browser app is finished
    launching, it searches the web with this term.

- Open a bookmark: [bookmark list].

    - These lists would appear as a grid.

- Open a bookmark from a menu.
- Search YouTube: [______].

It provides direct action to
open the app up with what you
are trying to do with it, regardless
of whether you have already opened
it.
