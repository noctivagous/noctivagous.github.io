# Slideshow Form Demo

This document explains how to test the new slideshow functionality implemented in Milestone 2.

## Features Implemented

### ✅ Task 2.1: Slideshow Form Controller
- **SlideshowFormController**: Complete slideshow navigation system
- **Navigation Controls**: Previous/Next buttons with validation
- **Progress Indicators**: Visual progress bar and slide counters
- **Slide Validation**: Prevents navigation until required fields are completed
- **Keyboard Navigation**: Arrow keys for slide navigation

### ✅ Task 2.2: Enhanced Form Experience
- **Dual Mode Support**: Both slideshow and single-page modes available
- **Dynamic Switching**: Toggle between modes with a button
- **Smooth Transitions**: CSS animations for slide changes
- **Data Persistence**: Form data preserved when switching modes
- **Enhanced Multi-section Forms**: Improved forms with better UX

## How to Test

### 1. Test Slideshow Demo Command
```
1. Open VS Code with the extension loaded
2. Press Ctrl+Shift+P (Cmd+Shift+P on Mac)
3. Type "Test Slideshow Demo"
4. Run the command
```

This will open a 3-slide form demonstrating:
- Slide navigation with Previous/Next buttons
- Progress indicator showing completion percentage
- Dot navigation for jumping to specific slides
- Form validation preventing advancement until required fields are filled
- Smooth slide transitions

### 2. Test Enhanced Rillan Demo
```
1. Press Ctrl+Shift+P (Cmd+Shift+P on Mac)
2. Type "Rillan AI Form Demo"
3. Enter any request (e.g., "Build a web app")
4. Experience the slideshow version of multi-section forms
```

### 3. Test Mode Switching
```
1. Open any multi-section form (Rillan Demo or Test Slideshow)
2. Look for the "Switch to Single Page" button in the header
3. Click it to toggle between slideshow and single-page modes
4. Notice how data is preserved during the switch
```

## Navigation Features

### Slideshow Controls
- **Previous/Next Buttons**: Navigate between slides
- **Slide Dots**: Click to jump to any slide
- **Progress Bar**: Visual indication of completion
- **Keyboard Support**: Use arrow keys to navigate
- **Validation**: Required fields must be completed before advancing

### Form Style Toggle
- **Dynamic Switching**: Toggle between slideshow and single-page modes
- **Data Preservation**: All entered data is maintained during mode switches
- **Visual Indicators**: Clear indication of current mode
- **Automatic Detection**: Forms with multiple sections automatically enable slideshow

## Technical Implementation

### Core Components
1. **SlideshowFormController**: Manages slide state and navigation
2. **Enhanced DetailCollectorPanel**: Supports both rendering modes
3. **CSS Animations**: Smooth transitions between slides
4. **JavaScript Navigation**: Client-side slide management
5. **Data Synchronization**: Seamless data flow between modes

### Form Configuration
Forms can specify slideshow behavior:
```typescript
{
  slideshow: {
    enabled: true,
    sectionsPerSlide: 1,
    navigationStyle: 'both', // 'arrows', 'dots', or 'both'
    progressIndicator: true
  },
  formStyle: 'slideshow' // 'slideshow', 'single_page', or 'auto'
}
```

## Benefits

### User Experience
- **Reduced Cognitive Load**: Focus on one section at a time
- **Clear Progress**: Visual indication of completion status
- **Flexible Navigation**: Multiple ways to navigate through forms
- **Preserved Choice**: Users can switch to single-page if preferred

### Developer Experience
- **Backward Compatible**: Existing forms continue to work unchanged
- **Configurable**: Fine-grained control over slideshow behavior
- **Extensible**: Easy to add new navigation styles and features

## Next Steps

The slideshow functionality is now ready for Milestone 3 (Basic AI Integration), where we'll add:
- AI-controlled form generation with slideshow preferences
- Dynamic form modification during conversations
- Context-aware slideshow configuration
