      Opportunities to Upgrade Computer Codeâ€™s Form inside The Editor

          </P>

          
    <p>
      Programming languages designed for application software development are more capable than a few decades
      ago, but not by much. Any progress has occurred inside the plain text file format.
      They haven't been upgraded in a comprehensive way that
      utilizes the new graphical capabilities of computers.  It's all terminal type.
      To give an illustrative example that adds to the two shown above, 
      an object variable should be assignable to an interactive vector field
      in the code editor.  A UI control embedded in a line of code can do much more than alphanumeric type
      in complex situations, across a wide range of subjects.  Instructions can someday be expressed semiotically, even,
      if graphics are embraced as elements inside a line of code.  So far, there has never been
      a semiotical programming language system.
      
      <p>
        When graphics are included, the resulting depth of command over the operations of a computer
      will not be matched by any current sequence of plain text.  Small experiments
      have shown that this is much superior,
      it's just that there are doubts expressed by some over whether it can match the
      speed of editing plain text&mdash; in other words the user interface. We address this here.  What seems like an insurmountable
      obstacle, making graphical code's interface comparable to plain text in editing power, is
      actually a matter of taking a different approach.  In every single case, previous attempts abandoned 
      too much of what was in active use in the practice of programming inside plain text and tried to come up with something foreign, which means
      that the code conventions did not match what people were trying to do when they program.
      Instead, Noctivagous' plan is to gradually add augmentations to plain text as it exists today.  A little bit
      later, code can break free from plain text and sit inside its own document file format.  (Already
      there are movements in this direction with Jupyter Notebook, just not for the code itself, only the output.)
      So, initially it is that UI and widgets additions are allowed inside a line of plain text code,
      just like right now when a color can be assigned to a color picker control. 
      After a color picker has been used in code for a while, it is felt as missing when not available. 
      In this way, graphical widgets and controls won't only be a matter of convenience.  When they
      are placed into code, they will be able to 
      summarize large sequences of computer instructions such that
      no one will want to go backwards to just typing out regular terminal type (monospaced type).
      <!--
          This is a path that makes sense because code's intricacies
      might be difficult to impose from the outside with an artificial scheme.

    -->

      <p>
        The importance of this effort can be explained in the following.
      Producing a competing web browser engine that is as
       complete as Chromium or WebKit can't be done in a short period
      of time, and when this isn't possible it represents a dead end for software
      development.  Those two software projects will never be unseated because
      there is little incentive to surpass them, as what is written from scratch 
      with current programming languages will
      basically end up being the same in outcome.  Even with AI programming
      assistants, this does not change because those engines have reached
      the ceiling of what plain text code will produce without an upgrade.
      
      </p>
      It is possible to escape this dead end, and it is by breaking from
      the fusion of computer code to the typewriter.  For a major upgrade to happen,
      alterations like the above image have to occur, because code has to look more like
      the software it produces, not just raw, monospaced type.  It has to be able to express
      complex operations in terms of signs and symbol someday.
       Computer science mindsets that refuse collaboration with graphic design
       won't suffice, then, as software development has stayed inside terminal
       type all this time.
      When code is upgraded, the initial subjects of concern turn out to be different;
      they will have to incorporate graphic design and media design
      principles.  The areas of expertise involved are often outside of what is 
      found in mainstream software engineering discussions.
      
      <p>
      As explained in the articles on this page, the obstacle to a deeper level of
      progress in software development is the confining, primitive offerings of the 
      file format plain text, that it has been stretched far beyond
      its bare capabilities to serve increasingly large and complex needs, blowing past 
      the environment of 1980s and 1990s computing when it formed the programming languages
      still in active use today, like C++, Python, and Java.
      
      This primitive code medium is largely accidental, it doesn't lend itself to a surveyable view, 
      a zoomable map like CAD, and it of course by definition cannot accommodate rich text inside the code
      without odd adaptations.  Since it has so many limitations for today's world, it has to be
      transcended.
    
    <p>
      A collection like an array or 
      dictionary  is still not
      editable by way of a data table GUI control inside a line of code.  Instead, the programmer clumsily
      navigates through commas with the arrow keys.
      In addition to this, future computer code needs to be editable in multiple newspaper-like columns to
      make efficient use of screen space.  Plain text is too raw of a file format for programming software in the 21st century,
      and it doesn't allow inclusion of modern GUI controls for formulating groups of instructions. 
      
    </p>

    <p>Noctivagous starts with the plain text code 
      as programmers work with it today and then adds GUI to that as the first step, continuing
      the trend of exists today where the value of a color variable is controllable by an inline color picker.
      It is believed that later the code file should be transformed into a document file format 
      for truly rich code editing.   Each article below explains these issues.</p>
