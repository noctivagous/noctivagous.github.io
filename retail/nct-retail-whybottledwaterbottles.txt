Why We Like To Use Bottled Water Bottles


   - The opening of the bottle is smaller than
   the person's mouth, unlike a glass or mug's opening,
which is wider.
    - Liquid won't overflow around the person's mouth
   like the mouth of a glass if there is a bump or movement.
    - A water bottle requires less active coordination than a glass, cup, or mug.
 
    
- The plastic bottle is closer to being spill-proof
    - If it falls on the floor, less liquid falls out
    because of small opening at top. 
    - When the container is picked up after a fall, the spill stops quickly,
    whereas a glass or mug spill is usually majority loss of liquid.
    - There is a cap for the bottle that is easily
    screwed on.   If it is on, the liquid loss from a fall
    will be nothing or a few drops.
    - Even with the cap off, during transport across a room
    the likelihood of some spillage is much lower than    a glass or cup
    
    
- very portable container because of cap
    - can be carried down the street, even tossed.
    - lightweight container
