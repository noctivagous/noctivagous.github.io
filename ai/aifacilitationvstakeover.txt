AI Facilitation of Work Processes vs. AI Takeover of Human Jobs

To facilitate cooking in the home, 
there can be a vegetable-cutting appliance product 
for the kitchen that will cut or dice any vegetable 
placed inside the box's bounds.  The existence of
this type of device would not be feasible earlier, 
before recent advances in AI, as the device
has to be able to recognize every type of vegetable
placed in it and how it needs to be peeled or cut.

The dimensions of this appliance would be be about the size 
of a large microwave with a price that is mostly 
affordable at the beginning.
This device would be utilized safely by the average 
citizen for convenient, at-home cooking.
Its purpose is deliberately limited to 
cutting and peeling of vegetables, which appears
at first to those who do not cook as an arbitrary
configuration or use of AI.  But those who cook
at home know that cutting vegetables is an involved
process, even if an food processor appliance is used, because
vegetables need to be cut and peeled for the food processor
and then the knives, and the cutting board, and
the food processor appliance itself all have to be cleaned afterwards.

When the vegetables are taken out of this AI-driven kitchen device
they are completely ready for cooking or assembling into
cold dishes.  The machine places the scraps, minced,
to the side of the cut vegetables for easy disposal 
or use, and because of this the device does not need to dispose 
of anything by itself through plumbing and is self-contained.

The point is that the device does not attempt to take over the entire
process of cooking but instead addresses an issue that
cooks encounter that can best be addressed by AI:
vegetable cutting is the main impediment to regular 
cooking at home, because even if people enjoy doing it
or they don't mind the chore, it creates a hassle that cannot
be easily overcome, because the extra work it creates
often takes too much time and has some amount of hidden
complexity.

Contrast this device and its goals with 
the conventional mentality and approach 
for making a kitchen appliance 
that incorporates AI: it will be a robot that has
arms and it will cook what it cuts too. Apart from requiring 
far more engineering and AI technology than can be affordable 
for the average person, this robot setup is unlikely
to be manufactured within a reasonable timeframe,
and will be a concept product for a long time, probably
limited to restaurants.  The size of the device will be large, the
assembly will require a professional, safety will be an issue
with large swinging parts, and it will not necessarily
fit in an average household kitchen or be worth it for most
people just to have an extra cook.  Thus the second
approach, this takeover of the whole process by making
a partial humanoid, is a poor line of approach for utilizing 
AI in an appliance for our times.  It also stirs a person inside, as the entire
process has been taken over completely--
supposedly for the purpose of making everyday
life easier.  Though it makes life easier in that way,
it doesn't have to do that, as we just demonstrated, 
and it takes cooking control away from the human.

The goal of an AI device should not be to
make life easy to the point that no human effort has to
be expended anywhere to make something occur,
but instead fix and facilitate existing processes
that carry complicated aspects that are causing problems,
because they are missing pieces to the puzzle.
To give another example, there are probably only a few parts of making
a road that need to be addressed by an AI machine
that would immediately make road construction
faster and more affordable, just like the vegetable-cutting
appliance, whereas the AI community
would start its road construction product by trying to do everything
from start to finish with a very large machine, something
unnecessary for making life better.  This is the discussion of AI takeover 
of an entire job versus AI facilitation of stage of the process. 
AI takeover is undesirable and is the prevalent mindset at AI
companies, whereas AI facilitation is basically
unknown, an absent topic.

At least in the short-term, it would be beneficial to
have a device that assists road construction
but does not try to take every aspect over from
the workers, beginning until end, because when a certain
shortcoming of the process has been addressed,
the solution provided by the AI will appear
immediately and the solution will 
be much more powerful, more feasible to actually
implement and put on the market, and it wonâ€™t 
replace humans who need to direct technology.
In other words, human will remain in control of the job.
For many reasons, addressing individual parts
of the road construction process is preferable to
an AI replacing humans doing any of it. In the case 
of the vegetable-cutting  device that can sit next to 
the microwave, the barrier to AI doing something
helpful is extremely low compared to
being extremely high, a big, expensive complicated robot screwed
into the wall.  The purpose of AI has not 
been confined but rather directed into a more rational
objective, to deal with what is currently wrong for
people's process.  It is an AI philosophy that 
does not aim to push people out of the
whole activity, such as to write the entire paper, to
make the entire illustration for them, to cook the entire meal
as predefined for them, to make the entire road, and 
thus the outcome will be higher quality and controllable.

This cannot be confused with applying
AI to just one function of a device, such as
putting machine learning inside something.
This involves going through the effort to 
identify what is missing first.  What is the 
obstacle in a given activity,
such as how home cooking is psychologically
and actually practically impeded by the
friction of having to peel and cut vegetables and 
then clean up the scraps afterwards.  By comparison,
the current intentions of AI research are lazy,
as they aren't willing examine what is wrong
in any given set of processes, just
make a one-size-fits all megamachine that takes
over everything that people do.

Of course in theory, a personal robot would take care of
everything from house cleaning to cooking, 
but in practice that will be expensive for a long time
and will not appear as a finished consumer product
for many years to come given the current state of
technology anyway.  So the first goal is
to identify this kind of excessive optimism in
the tech industry that can never deliver such products
on time and admit that for AI to truly serve people it 
has to be applied to existing situations such that it lubricates
the gears of life situations, not usurps entire jobs
of everyday life.  If something helpful makes people 
uncomfortable, it isn't worth it and is following 
the wrong track.

There is also a lack of clarity of purpose of
something like ChatGPT, because on the surface
it would be to write papers for people from
start to finish so that they don't have to
do anything, or write entire computer programs
for them from start to finish that compile. 
That is at first glance what its purpose would be.
It will be a long time before that happens and in the
first place it would then be literature that
is AI-flavored no matter how the AI was constructed.
It would then be a new culture of AI-directed 
app programming instead of replacing 
regular programming.  Then the AI companies
retreat from this position and say that the GPT
is a tool for all kinds of tasks (as long as you
can figure out what they are and how to get it
to do them), which it certainly can serve as
quite capably, but that wasn't really how the GPT
was setup, so there is a misalignment of stated
product offering and the form that the product
takes.
