THE USER'S MODES OF INTERACTING WITH AI IN THIS SOFTWARE

So this then leads into another topic which is that the user is making use of AI
in different modes.  Sometimes the user just needs a one-off exchange, sometimes
it is just a quick response needed, but other times that one-off exchange still
would benefit from some preliminary information gathered by the AI and a few
interactive menus.  Then there is another mode where the user asked how to do a
thing. The AI would in this case generate walkthrough menus and if at any step
the user had a problem he could respond within that step and the AI would help
solve the problem within it.  This would take a slideshow form.  This would work
for tutorials, guides, and so on.  So there are the uses of the AI, the modes of
interaction the user wants with it, and the form that shows up in the GUI
(slideshows).



Modes of Interaction with AI


Key scenarios—quick one-off exchanges, enhanced quick responses with preliminary
information, and step-by-step tutorial modes—and how these can be supported in a
graphical user interface (GUI). Let’s break this down and expand on how these
modes can be implemented effectively.

```
1. Quick One-Off Exchange  
Description: The user needs a fast, concise answer to a simple query  
(e.g., "What’s the capital of France?").  
Implementation: The AI delivers an immediate response, such as  
"The capital of France is Paris." No additional interaction is required  
unless the user requests more.  
GUI Role: Minimal text output suffices here, keeping the interaction  
lightweight and efficient.

2. Enhanced Quick Response with Preliminary Information  
Description: Even for quick queries, gathering preliminary information  
or offering options can improve relevance (e.g., "Give me a recipe for dinner"  
could prompt questions about dietary preferences).  
Implementation: The AI can present a brief interactive menu or a few  
targeted questions before responding: Example:  
"Do you want a vegetarian recipe? Any ingredient restrictions?"  
Once the user selects or inputs their preferences, the AI delivers  
a tailored response.  
GUI Role: A small pop-up menu or a single-slide interface with  
buttons/text inputs ensures speed while adding value.

3. Tutorial or Guide Mode  
Description: The user asks how to perform a task  
(e.g., "How do I bake a cake?"), and the AI provides a detailed,  
step-by-step walkthrough with problem-solving support.  
Implementation: The AI generates a slideshow or interactive menu  
breaking the task into steps: Each step is presented sequentially,  
with options to interact (e.g., "Ask a question," "Show more details").  
If the user encounters an issue (e.g., "My batter is lumpy"), they  
can respond within that step, and the AI offers targeted help  
(e.g., "Try whisking it longer").  
GUI Role: A slideshow format shines here, guiding the user through  
the process with visual and interactive elements.

Enhancing These Modes with Interactive Features

Interactive Menus  
Quick Responses: Menus can refine vague queries fast. For instance,  
if a user asks "Tell me about AI," a menu could offer: "History,"  
"Applications," or "Ethics."  
Tutorials: Menus within each step could provide additional resources  
(e.g., "Watch a video," "See an example").

Slideshows  
Quick Responses: A brief slideshow (e.g., 2-3 slides) could summarize  
key points for slightly complex queries, like "What’s climate change?"  
showing causes, effects, and solutions.  
Tutorials: Slideshows excel at breaking down tasks:  
    Slide 1: "Gather ingredients."  
    Slide 2: "Mix dry ingredients."  
    Slide 3: "Bake at 350°F for 30 minutes."  
Interactive elements (buttons, text inputs) let users engage at each step.
