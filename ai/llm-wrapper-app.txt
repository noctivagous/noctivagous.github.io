LLM Wrapper App

A wrapper app for an LLM is to be made that goes
beyond the basic AI chatbot format wherein the user
is only given a textbox and is restricted to using this alone.
The AI chatbox textbox means the user starts from scratch each
time with prompts, writing everything out even when the 
use of the LLM would benefit from presets with parameters.  

This app will provide prompts, parameters, and settings for
producing the prompts rapidly.  This will be possible in
an app suite, made of traditional controls and functions, and menus.
Menus divide interactivity with the LLM into
categories that assist the user in generating prompts according
to the use.  This is to provide starting points for the LLM
for the user that are more productive than a bare text box, which
can be considered too simple and tiring when there is
such a wide range of situations for which a person might use an LLM
and such a large number of instances when the prompts could be
formulated with convenient, traditional app user interface.
The presets within each category will facilitate valuable
usage of the LLM for that category.

This is product development that extends beyond the basic AI
chatbot but continues to work with the LLM with interactive
conveniences.


Categories and app menu sections include the following:

1) (Default) Continue/Comment On/Make Response to (provided text).
2) Inquiry/Explain a Subject (generate a profile or background on a topic).   Provide reading list for subject.
3) Manufacture/Generate Text: literature, poem, essay, possible business names, according to specs.  
4) Programming Code.  Operations, Generate Code, Answer Question.
5) How-to (how to do a thing).  Solutions for a Problem.
6) Veracity check (find out if something is true generally).
7) Explain provided text.  It's Origin / It's meaning
8) Data:  Generate Data (e.g. weather for a region).  Reformat provided data.
Check for condition in provided data/text.  Analyze.
9) Converse, Simulate Interaction: role-playing, simulated interviews, 
language learning, and other interactive sessions designed to mimic real-life interactions.
10) Education. Typical course curriculum for a subject.  Describe prerequisites.
11) Proofread / Copyedit / Rephrase


-----

Continue/Comment On/Make Response to: This would enable users to 
build upon or have the LLM respond to existing text, whether it's their own or
provided by the LLM, fostering interactive.  Dialectical benefits for
the user of the LLM which is that there is the ability to see
a broader view of the topic by having the LLM response.


Inquiry/Explain a Subject: Users could utilize the LLM 
to research and generate informative profiles or backgrounds 
on a wide range of topics, as well as receive curated reading

Manufacture/Generate Text: This would allow users 
to generate various types of written content, 
from literature and poetry to business name ideas and essays, 
based on specified parameters or prompts. 
The LLM could draw upon its broad knowledge to produce
 high-quality, original text tailored to the user's needs.
 
Programming Code: This section would enable 
users to leverage the LLM's capabilities for 
software development, including generating code, 
answering programming-related questions, and 
even performing various code operations like 
refactoring, optimization, or debugging.

How-to and Solutions for Problems: This feature would allow users to 
obtain step-by-step instructions or solutions for a variety of 
tasks and challenges, drawing on the LLM's extensive knowledge 
and problem-solving abilities.  Especially relevant to household
tasks, home improvement, automotive repair, questions about
machines, appliances, etc.

Veracity Check: Users could use this feature to assess the 
truthfulness or accuracy of claims, information, or statements, 
leveraging the LLM's understanding of factual knowledge and its

Explain Provided Text: Users could leverage this feature to gain 
insights into the origin, meaning, and context of a given text, 
helping to deepen their understanding.  Especially useful for
older texts.

Data Generation and Analysis: The LLM could be used to generate, 
format, and analyze various types of data, from weather forecasts 
to statistical insights, providing users with valuable information 
and insights. 

Converse, Simulate Interaction: This section would allow users 
to engage in more immersive and interactive experiences, such 
as role-playing, simulated interviews, and language learning 
exercises, helping to bridge the gap between the LLM and real-world interactions.
Education: The LLM could be utilized to provide information on typical course curricula for different subjects, as well as describe the prerequisites and other relevant details to support educational and learning goals.
