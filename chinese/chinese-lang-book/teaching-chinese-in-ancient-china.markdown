### Teaching Chinese in Ancient China Before Phonetic Systems

In ancient China, before the development of phonetic systems like *zhuyin* (early 20th century) or *pinyin* (1950s), the Chinese language was taught primarily through memorization, recitation, and contextual understanding, given the logographic nature of Chinese characters. Here’s how it was typically done:

1. **Rote Memorization and Repetition**:
   - Students, often young children, memorized Chinese characters and classical texts through repeated recitation. Texts like the *Three Character Classic* (*Sanzi Jing*), *Thousand Character Classic* (*Qianzi Wen*), and Confucian classics were foundational.
   - Teachers would write characters on wooden or bamboo slips (later paper) and have students copy them repeatedly to internalize their forms, meanings, and stroke orders.
   - Pronunciation was taught orally by imitating the teacher, as there was no standardized phonetic system. Regional dialects influenced pronunciation, but classical Chinese (*wenyanwen*) was the written standard, prioritizing meaning over spoken variation.

2. **Character-Based Learning**:
   - Chinese characters were taught as logographs, where each character represented a word or morpheme. Students learned the meaning and usage of characters through their context in texts.
   - Radical-based organization (components of characters indicating meaning or category) helped students categorize and understand characters. For example, characters with the water radical (氵) often relate to water or liquids.
   - Calligraphy practice reinforced character recognition and aesthetic appreciation, as writing was an art form tied to scholarly prestige.

3. **Classical Texts and Moral Education**:
   - Education focused on Confucian classics (e.g., *Analects*, *Book of Rites*) to instill moral values and cultural knowledge. Students memorized these texts, which were written in classical Chinese, a formal written language distinct from spoken vernaculars.
   - Teachers explained texts’ meanings, often linking characters to philosophical or practical concepts, such as Truthfulness-Benevolence-Forbearance (*Zhen-Shan-Ren*), which could appear in moral teachings.

4. **Master-Apprentice Model**:
   - Learning was often one-on-one or in small groups with a scholar or tutor. The teacher modeled pronunciation and explained character meanings, relying on oral transmission.
   - No phonetic aids existed, so students relied on the teacher’s spoken dialect and their ability to memorize pronunciations alongside character meanings.

5. **Rhyme Books and Tone Patterns**:
   - By the Tang dynasty (618–907 CE), rhyme books like the *Qieyun* categorized characters by pronunciation, focusing on tones and syllable finals. These were used by advanced scholars to standardize pronunciation for poetry and exams but weren’t widespread in early education.
   - Students learned tones through recitation patterns, as Chinese is a tonal language, but this was intuitive rather than systematic without phonetic notation.

This system was labor-intensive, requiring years to master thousands of characters. It prioritized literacy in classical Chinese for scholarly and bureaucratic purposes, as mastery was essential for the imperial examination system (*keju*), which tested candidates on classical texts for government positions.

### Western Scholars Learning Chinese in the 20th Century

Western scholars in the 20th century faced unique challenges learning Chinese due to its logographic script, tonal pronunciation, and lack of direct equivalents in alphabetic languages. Their methods evolved with increasing access to China and linguistic advancements. Here’s how they approached it:

1. **Missionary and Diplomatic Beginnings**:
   - Early in the 20th century, Western scholars, often missionaries (e.g., Jesuits) or diplomats, learned Chinese through immersion in China or from Chinese tutors. They resided in cities like Beijing or Shanghai, learning spoken dialects like Mandarin or Cantonese.
   - Missionaries like Robert Morrison (1782–1834, though pre-20th century) created dictionaries (e.g., *A Dictionary of the Chinese Language*, 1815–1823), which 20th-century scholars still used. These works paired Chinese characters with English translations and approximate pronunciations using Roman letters.
   - Scholars memorized characters through repetitive writing and relied on native speakers for pronunciation, similar to ancient Chinese methods.

2. **Use of Romanization Systems**:
   - By the early 20th century, Romanization systems like Wade-Giles (developed in the 19th century) were widely used by Westerners to approximate Chinese pronunciation. For example, Beijing was written as “Peking” in Wade-Giles.
   - Wade-Giles was not fully standardized and struggled with tones (e.g., using superscripts like *ma¹* for tones), so scholars supplemented it with direct instruction from native speakers.
   - The Yale Romanization system, developed in the 1940s for U.S. military language training, gained popularity for its simpler tone representation, aiding scholars during and after World War II.

3. **Textbooks and Grammars**:
   - Western scholars relied on textbooks like those by George Kennedy (e.g., *Introduction to Literary Chinese*, 1943) or James Legge’s translations of Confucian classics. These provided character glossaries, grammar explanations, and cultural context.
   - Grammars often focused on classical Chinese for academic study, but vernacular Chinese (*baihua*) gained attention as modern literature and newspapers grew. Scholars like John DeFrancis published textbooks like *Beginning Chinese* (1946), emphasizing spoken Mandarin.

4. **Immersion and Language Schools**:
   - By the mid-20th century, language schools in China (e.g., the Peking Language School, later Beijing Language and Culture University) offered structured courses for foreigners. Scholars attended these or studied in Taiwan after the Chinese Civil War (1949), where Mandarin was standardized.
   - Immersion involved living with Chinese families, attending classes, and practicing tones through conversation. Tones were a major hurdle, often requiring drills and listening exercises with native speakers.

5. **Dictionaries and Linguistic Tools**:
   - Dictionaries like Herbert Giles’ *A Chinese-English Dictionary* (1892, updated 1912) and later R.H. Mathews’ *Chinese-English Dictionary* (1943) were critical. They organized characters by radicals and provided Wade-Giles pronunciations.
   - Scholars learned to navigate dictionaries using radical and stroke-count systems, a skill akin to that of ancient Chinese students, to look up unfamiliar characters.

6. **Cultural and Contextual Study**:
   - Understanding Chinese required cultural knowledge, as characters often carried historical or philosophical weight. For example, scholars studying Confucian texts encountered concepts like Truthfulness-Benevolence-Forbearance (*Zhen-Shan-Ren*), which they learned through translations and explanations tying characters to moral principles.
   - Western scholars often studied classical Chinese first, as it was the basis for much of China’s literary tradition, before tackling vernacular speech.

7. **Challenges with Tones and Characters**:
   - Tones were notoriously difficult for Western learners, as European languages lack tonal distinctions. Scholars used mnemonic devices or tone charts and practiced with native speakers to master the four tones of Mandarin.
   - Memorizing thousands of characters required flashcards, repetitive writing, and reading graded texts. Some scholars focused on recognizing characters visually before mastering their pronunciation.

8. **Post-1950s Developments**:
   - After the People’s Republic of China introduced *pinyin* in the 1950s, some Western scholars adopted it, especially post-1970s when China opened to the West. *Pinyin* provided a standardized Romanization system, making pronunciation easier to learn systematically.
   - Language programs in Western universities (e.g., Harvard, SOAS in London) incorporated *pinyin* and modern textbooks, though many scholars still learned classical Chinese for academic research.

### Key Differences
- **Ancient China**: Relied on oral transmission, rote memorization, and classical texts without phonetic aids. Education was elite-focused, tied to Confucian values and exams.
- **20th-Century Western Scholars**: Used Romanization systems (Wade-Giles, Yale, later *pinyin*), dictionaries, and immersion. They balanced classical and vernacular Chinese, driven by academic, missionary, or diplomatic needs.
