NOCTIVAGOUS DESKTOP OS

A calculator doesn't have to be opened as a separate app
inside the File Navigator.  Relatively lightweight
viewing and editing programs can be embedded into
the File Navigator.  Viewers and editors for various 
file types can be installed as extensions and open
up windows within the File Navigator.
When the activity is more involved and takes more time, 
the user can open up an app.

This also holds true for batch operations applied to
files.  It should be possible in the File Navigator
to make use of another type of extension which are 
GUI wrappers for terminal commands and, 
for example, select 10 images and have the File Navigator
make a new directory where they are all sized in different
combinations.  The File Navigator should be much more
extended.

EXTENDING THE FILE NAVIGATOR

File Navigator --> Workspace (File Navigator + Extended Functions)

Some functionality found in smaller apps, such as text editing 
and basic photo editing, should be available inside
the File Navigator without launching a separate app.

	- Make a blank text file and edit it.
	- Open up a text editor.
	- Go through a PDF.
	

When a window opens that views or edits files in
the workspace, it can have a different appearance.

For full spreadsheet editing, the user opens up the
spreadsheet app.  But for just editing or looking at
the document in a normal window size, this can be an extension
to the File Navigator.

Since there will be a lot of windows, it will
	
The Finder or File Navigator should be much more capable 
of producing editing, and processing files.  It should 
be able to perform editing functions on many file types
without launching apps.   These would be extensions built
for the File Navigator.

INTEGRATION OF THE WEB INTO FILES IN THE FILE NAVIGATOR.

If a file contains a link to a website and it ends 
in .weburl the File Navigator can view the website
inside the File Navigator (with a WebView) without having 
to open up a web browser.  But importantly, interactions
that take place within this WebView can directly connect
to the File Navigator, allowing the user to make
a drag-line, for example, from a hyperlink inside
the WebView to a file system location.


APP CONTAINING WINDOWS

The typical File Navigator window of today 
shows a list of files or links in the leftmost panel
and then files are navigated to the right.
A list view in the leftmost panel can be clicked on 
and maintained.

In fact a window like this, where there is a list
on the left, can be a container for the smaller apps
like we just mentioned, with the list being
various programs that are open that are extensions
installed in the File Navigator such as calculator
or lightweight spreadsheet editor.
