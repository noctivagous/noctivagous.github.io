LayoutBox has two var sets:
	parentWidth parentHeight -- for interiorChildren
		

	globalWidth globalHeight -- for surroundingChildren	
		-- every surroundingChild LayoutBox
		is given this variable so that all surroundingChildren
		at each level of the tree know the bounds of, say,
		the web browser viewport.
		

LayoutBox has two children arrays:

	interiorChildren  (inside the bounds)
		layoutboxes that sit inside the bounds

		which sit inside its own bounds.
		(a gridbox child will use its bounds
		for the perimeter of making a grid).



	surroundingChildren  (outside the bounds)
		layoutboxes that sit to the side, on top, below, etc.

		relationship: 
			adjacent (no overlap)
			adjacent-below (if negative margins)
			adjacent-above (if negative margins)
						above (on top)
			below (below)
			opposite-side (e.g. flashcard)
		positioning:
			edge-on-edge
			corner


		which follow in terms of pageflow,
		as on a web page.
		a neighbor can sit to the left
		or the right of the "parent" and draws itself
		in relation to the parent.



-----------------------------------------------------------------
-- The NCTLayoutEngine is general purpose
for layout out bounding boxes in an XML
format.

The way to understand it is how it came
about.  It started with the need to make three bounding rectangles 
for the first three components of a vector drawing
program : the canvas viewport for where the
the vector drawing takes place and the right and bottom
scroll bars.  From there, other cases were added
to the layout engine.

NCTLayoutEngine does not define layout boxes' dimensions 
in terms of their width and height directly.  
We will explain with this example of the vector drawing program.
In NCTLayoutEngine, the first thing that happens is that a person
is provided the bounds of the window's
content view.  For the program, we make three separate <LayoutBox/>
tags that inherit from the root tage. The attributes of
our <LayoutBox/> tag have power in order.  Their operations accumulate
and the later ones override the previous.
If you do nothing and leave an empty <LayoutBox/>, you inherit the parent 
tag's full bounds.

The goal of the engine is to provide the user multiple
approaches for doing the same thing, according to what
is most natural at the time.

----- For our example of the vector-drawing program,
to make the viewport (canvas) rectangle that spans most of the height and width of the
window's content view except for the right
and bottom scrollbars that take up 15pt, 
we only have to use the first layout operation, the pullAwayFromEdges attribute:

<LayoutBox pullAwayFromEdges="fromBottomByPt:15;fromRightByPt:15;" guiControl="canvas"/>

With this we have subtracted the bottom and right portions,
leaving only what the canvas has.

Next, we do the two scrollbars.  For these, we only have to use
the extrude operation, from the bottom edge for the bottom scrollbar 
for its <LayoutBox/>, and from the right edge for the right scrollbar
for its <LayoutBox/>:

<LayoutBox extrude="fromBottomEdgeByPt:15;" guiControl="horizScrollbar"/>

<LayoutBox extrude="fromRightEdgeByPt:15;" guiControl="vertScrollbar"/>

What if you did both operations, pullAwayFromEdges, and extrude?
They are conflicting operations.   NCTLayoutEngine is designed such that there is
an official order of operations, even though these operations are attributes in XML tags. 
Each subsequent operation will override the previous ones if there
is any conflict.

Layout Options

The order is:

1. pullAwayFromEdges: Supports fixed length and fractional margin settings.
2. extrude: Offers fixed length and fractional extrusion from edges.
3. adhereToEdges: Allows adherence to specific edges of the parent container.
4. adhereToCorners: Enables positioning at specific corners of the parent container.


-- pullAwayFromEdges
options:
   fixed length in points: allEdgesByByPt, topEdgeByPt,  rightEdgeByPt, bottomEdgeByPt, leftEdgeByPt
   a fraction of the parent rect: allEdgesByFrac, topEdgeByFrac,  rightEdgeByFrac, bottomEdgeByFrac, leftEdgeByFrac

-- extrude
options:
  fixed length in points: fromBottomEdgeByPt,fromRightEdgeByPt,fromLeftEdgeByPt,
fromTopEdgeByPt
  a fraction of the parent rectangle's X or Y dimension: 
  fromBottomEdgeByFrac,fromRightEdgeByFrac,fromLeftEdgeByFrac,
fromTopEdgeByFrac

-- adhereToEdges
options: topEdge, rightEdge,bottomEdge ,leftEdge

-- adhereToCorners
options:topLeftCorner, topRightCorner, bottomLeftCorner, bottomRightCorner.


For example, if pullAwayFromEdges 
creates a margin but adhereToEdges specifies 
adherence to an edge, the adherence rule 
would override the margin for that particular edge.


Convenience attributes for LayoutBox

The options provided let you do many common situations.
But NCTLayoutEngine also provides some convenience attributes.

centerBoxPt:

Center the box on the screen some width and height pt away from
the edges.
<LayoutBox centerBoxPt="pullAwayWidth:15;pullAwayHeight:15"/>

which is the same as

<LayoutBox pullAwayFromEdges="fromBottomByPt:15;fromRightByPt:15;fromLeftByPt:15;fromTopByPt:15;"/>




A layout becomes sophisticated easily because
-- child LayoutBoxes inherit the parent box dimensions,
meaning that all that has to happen is the subsequent
dividing up of space at each level of the tree.
-- Importantly, layout is the primary driver of the engine, not the GUI
controls.  Typically a GUI control carryies
its own layout information.  In this case, everything in
the render tree is a LayoutBox that carries its own guicontrol. 
It has an array of LayoutBox children.

Layout Carries GUI Objects

Since layout is primary in a GUI, LayoutBoxes carry the GUI control
as their own property, and they send bounding rect updates to their control.
The NCTLayoutEngine is comprised of a layout tree of LayoutBoxes.
Mouse and key events are analyzed by the LayoutBox and sent to the GUI
control if needed.


<Layer width="1920" height="1080">
<LayoutBox />
</Layer>


Versus a Web Site

Boxes in a web page have 
definable height and width.

and their x and y positions
can go beneath the parent bounds.

Their dimensions and location 
are not defined in relation
to the parent viewport bounds.

If you had a PageLayoutBox you 
would provide it just parentWidth 
and it could lay children out
according to flow rules and
direction.
