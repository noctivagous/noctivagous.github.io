The definition of crowdfunding a goal should be associated with either the all-or-nothing mechanism or a similar means of achieving consensus.  In these cases the collection of money is more participatory; it  demand higher levels of personal investment from the project organizer and consequently elicits greater interest from observers and and contributors.  There is a heightened level of accountability placed on the project organizer, as it is not just a donation box passed around with short title and paragraph stating where the money will go.  Online fundraising carries more short-term goals in which there is less documentation and explanation of where the money will go, etc.  Thus crowdfunding is not supposed to be synonymous with online fundraising, as that is just a financial progress bar tied to a simple goal.  The planning for a crowdfunding project is supposed to be more developed.  When the consensus mechanisms are in play, the range of project category is broader; people will not normally donate charitably to see a product exist.  The crowdfunding projects feature shot and edited videos, their descriptions show schedules.  More work is put into them.
