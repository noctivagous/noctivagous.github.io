<h1>The Key-Click UI</h1>
<p>The key-click UI is an improved software user interface for the desktop computer.  

<br><br>A software program that implements the key-click UI treats the keys 
on a keyboard as click buttons.  The mouse buttons are entirely ignored.
Although this can be explained, before reading further, please try out the vector-drawing demo below.

<p>
The concept is that&mdash; and real-world use of the key-click UI has shown&mdash;
there is currently too much work assigned to an individual hand.  
Compared to the key-click UI, the hand is currently burdened. 
It has to do two things at once: coordinate the position of the cursor <i>and</i> click the buttons with the index finger.
In a vector-drawing program, especially, this causes problems; the
mouse interface wasn't ever intended to be used for drawing vectors.  Thus, to
establish a normal situation for 
drawing vectors with a mouse, it's important first to modify the overall interface.


<!--
<p>The key-click UI is not in contradiction with the history of the mouse, as Douglas Engelbart's
  1968 demo of the mouse in fact also featured a .  During the demo, to the left of his keyboard
  he was using a five-key device in tandem with the mouse, which also had click buttons.  
  That five-key device did not make it into personal computers but its essence is the same as the key-click UI.
 </p>
-->



 <p>Separating the click from the mouse divides the labor of
  manipulating the cursor's activity to two hands instead of one. This leads to a leap in possible dexterity.
  Each hand has been given its own role: the mouse hand just moves the cursor and
  the clicking hand just clicks with keys.  This opens up a totally different interactive 
  dynamic with the desktop computer, because previously there was never such alternation occuring between
  two hands (move, click, move, click).

<h1>Implementing Selection And Dragging of Objects in The Key-Click UI</h1>

<p>

  The following is not yet available in the web demo above but will be 
  in the future.  It is part of Floating Marker, a vector-drawing app.


  <h2>The <kbd>Tab</kbd> Key Is Used for The Selection Click</h2>
  <p>

  To select an individual object, you press the
  <kbd>tab</kbd> key, and it is selected immediately underneath the cursor
  as if you had pressed <kbd>shift</kbd>+<kbd>left mouse button</kbd>. The

  <kbd>tab</kbd> key
  selects and de-selects. It is the <i>selection
    click</i>.



  <p>Though any key could be used for this,  <kbd>tab</kbd>
  has been chosen because of its location on the keyboard.


The purpose of assigning <kbd>shift</kbd>+<kbd>left mouse button</kbd>
to the <kbd>tab</kbd> key is that the key-click UI works better with the <kbd>shift</kbd> modifier for selections 
most of the time. For one, it is far easier to select multiple objects at a time with the key-click UI, so
<kbd>shift</kbd> is implemented.
Tweaks and modifications like this are needed to make the key-click UI translate existing conventions.
  Just like before, clicking outside of the selection de-selects everything.
</p>

<h2>The <kbd>Spacebar</kbd> Implements a Drag-Lock on The Current Selection</h2>
  <p>
    In a convention specific to the key-click UI, the <kbd>tab</kbd> key has been paired with the <kbd>spacebar</kbd> 
    key to move objects around the screen.

    <p>
  To drag an object, you press
  the <kbd>spacebar</kbd> key after the object has been selected (using <kbd>tab</kbd> click), and the
  object moves in lock step with the cursor. In other words, this is a drag lock, affixing objects to the
  cursor relative to their position at the time of the drag lock. To release the drag lock, press the <kbd>spacebar</kbd> key again
  and then the objects are left at their location.
  
  <p>
    For ease of terminology this is called a drag lock, but it is also called
  "carting" by Noctivagous, in place of "dragging". It is named as such because a cart moves its contents
  briskly using wheels on the ground whereas the act of dragging something on the ground makes lots of noise.
  That is what using carting is like, that's the difference in UI improvement.
</p>

<h2>The <kbd>Escape</kbd> Key Cancels All Drag Locks And Selections</h2>

<p>If the  <kbd>Escape</kbd> is pressed and there is any drag lock occurring, it will
be turned off.  The current selection will be canceled as well.
Using the <kbd>Escape</kbd> for this is not only a convenience, it fits into the whole 
of using of the keyboard to click when using the key-click UI.</p>


<h2>The Opportunities That Arise When The Drag Lock Is Used</h2>

<p>Moving objects around on screen is very smooth when a drag lock is
  used in the way described above.  But in addition to this, it provides
  opportunities to operate with the selection or apply functions to it.
</p>

<p>In a vector-drawing program, the selection is be scaled up or down with
  the bracket keys (<kbd>[</kbd> and <kbd>]</kbd>). 
  
  The two keys below the bracket keys (<kbd>;</kbd> and <kbd>'</kbd>)
  rotate the selection by an increment of 15 degrees clockwise and counterclockwise.

  The selection can be stamped 
  with the <kbd>E</kbd> key.  So this means that transformed copies of
  the dragged selection can occur in real time.  This is how Floating Marker works.

</p>

<!--For example, in a desktop user interface, if the <kbd>K</kbd> key
is used for copying an object into multiple folders.</p>-->
