Kiosks And Maps Are Missing From Retail Stores


It is now a habit to acquire to look up
an item's aisle location online before 
you walk into a Home Depot or Wal-mart.

Why should customers ever have 
to ask employees where something
is located when the big box retail stores
could easily set up kiosk computers
throughout the store with store maps
on them and a search app?  They leave
these on the employees' mobile phones
and store computers.

Especially hardware stores like Home Depot
or Lowes should do this.  It's
definitely something Wal-mart
and Target should do.  When
you walk in, you should come across a
poster-sized overview map, just like a shopping
mall has except this time it is just for sections
of an individual store.  This has existed
for a long time for multi-floor department 
stores, but it is also important
for big box retail stores to have it.
