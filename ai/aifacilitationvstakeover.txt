AI Facilitation of Work Processes vs. AI Takeover of Human Jobs


To facilitate cooking in the home, 
there can a vegetable-cutting appliance product 
for the kitchen that will cut or dice any vegetable 
placed inside its box's bounds.  This would not
be feasible earlier, before AI, as the device
would be unable to recognize every type of vegetable
and how it needs to be peeled or cut.

The dimensions of this device can be about the size 
of a large microwave with a cost to the consumer that is 
relatively affordable when manufactured at scale.  
This device can be utilized safely by the average 
citizen for convenient, at-home cooking.
Its purpose is deliberately limited to 
cutting and peeling of vegetables, which appears
at first to those who do not cook as an arbitrary
configuration or use of AI.  But those who cook
at home know that cutting vegetables is an involved
process, even if food processors are used, because
vegetables need to be prepared for the food processor
and then that appliance, the knives, and the cutting board
all have to be cleaned afterwards.

When the vegetables are taken out of this AI-driven device
they are ready for cooking assembling into
cold dishes for refrigeration.  The scraps are placed, minced,
to the side of the cut vegetables for easy disposal 
(or use), and so the device does not need to dispose 
of anything itself.   

Note that the device does not attempt to take over the entire
process of cooking but instead addresses an issue that
cooks encounter that can best be addressed by AI:
vegetable cutting is a principal impediment to regular 
cooking at home, because even if people enjoy doing it
or they don't mind, it creates a hassle that cannot
be easily overcome because of the work it creates
as a byproduct.

Contrast this device and its goals with 
the typical approaches for making a kitchen appliance 
that incorporate AI: it will be a robot that will have 
arms and it will cook too. Apart from requiring more 
far engineering and AI technology than can be affordable 
for the average person, this robot setup is unlikely
to be manufactured in a reasonable amount of time,
and will be a concept product for a very long time,
limited to restaurants.  The size of the device will be large, the
assembly will be complicated, safety will be an issue
with large swinging parts, and it will not necessarily
fit in an average household kitchen or be worth it
just to have an extra cook.  Thus the second
approach, the takeover of the whole process by making
a partial humanoid, is a poor line of approach for utilizing 
AI.  It also stirs a person inside, as the entire
process has been taken over completely, 
supposedly for the purpose of making everyday
life easier.  Though it makes life easier in that way
it doesn't have to do that and it takes control
away from the human.

The goal of an AI device should not be to
make life easy to the point no effort has to
be expended anywhere to make something occur,
but instead to facilitate existing processes
that have complicated aspects causing problems 
because they are missing pieces to the puzzle.
There are probably only a few parts of making
a road that could be addressed by an AI machine
and this would immediately make road construction
faster and more affordable, whereas the AI community
would start its product trying to do everything
from start to finish with a single machine, something
unnecessary.  This is the discussion of AI takeover 
of a job versus AI facilitation of stage of the process. 
AI takeover is undesirable and is the prevalent mindset at AI
companies, whereas AI facilitation is basically
unknown, an absent topic.

In the short-term, it would be beneficial to
have a device that assists road construction
but does not try to take it all over from
the workers, beginning until end, because when a certain
shortcoming of the process has been addressed,
the solution provided by the AI will appear
immediately, in the solution will 
be much more powerful, more feasible to actually
put on the market, and not replace humans who
need to direct technology instead be taken over by it.
For many reasons, addressing individual parts
of the road construction process is preferable to
an AI replacing humans, as in the case of the vegetable cutting 
device that can sit next to the microwave because
the barrier to entry is extremely low compared to
being extremely high. The purpose of AI has not 
been made narrow or confined but rather more rational,
to deal with what is currently wrong for
people's process.  It is an AI philosophy that 
does not aim to push people out of the
whole activity, to write the entire paper, to
make the entire image, to cook the entire meal,
to make the entire road, and thus the outcome
will be higher quality and controllable.

This cannot be confused with applying
AI to just one function of a device, such as
putting machine learning inside something.
This involves going through the effort to 
identify what is missing first.  What is the 
obstacle in a given activity,
such as how home cooking is psychologically
and actually practically impeded by the
friction of having to peel and cut vegetables and 
then clean up the scraps afterwards.  By comparison,
the current intentions of AI research are lazy,
as they aren't willing examine what is wrong
in any given set of processes, just
make a one-size-fits all megamachine that takes
over everything that people do.

Of course in theory, a personal robot would take care of
everything from house cleaning to cooking, 
but in practice that will be expensive for a long time
and will not appear as a finished consumer product
for many years to come given the current state of
technology anyway.  So the first goal is
to identify this kind of excessive optimism in
the tech industry that can never deliver such products
on time and admit that for AI to truly serve people it 
has to be applied to existing situations such that it lubricates
the gears of life situations, not usurps entire jobs
of everyday life.  If something helpful makes people 
uncomfortable, it isn't worth it and is following 
the wrong track.

There is also a lack of clarity of purpose of
something like ChatGPT, because on the surface
it would be to write papers for people from
start to finish so that they don't have to
do anything, or write entire computer programs
for them from start to finish that compile. 
That is at first glance what its purpose would be.
It will be a long time before that happens and in the
first place it would then be literature that
is AI-flavored no matter how the AI was constructed.
It would then be a new culture of AI-directed 
app programming instead of replacing 
regular programming.  Then the AI companies
retreat from this position and say that the GPT
is a tool for all kinds of tasks (as long as you
can figure out what they are and how to get it
to do them), which it certainly can serve as
quite capably, but that wasn't really how the GPT
was setup, so there is a misalignment of stated
product offering and the form that the product
takes.
