MEASURING THE UTILITY AND COMPLETENESSOF A PRODUCT: The iPod Test - Will You Use It Regularly?
noctivagous.github.io
Noctivagous' concept, "The iPod Test" is the requirement that a
a consumer product is measured by the following questions.It represents the reception of a product by the consumer.-- Do you want to use it regularly because you find it helpful?  
-- How does it help you? -- Does it eventually become something of great value to you?  
The electric pressure cooker passes the iPod test
and the air fryer does so as well because of the cookingconveniences the two appliances provide.  All peoplewho purchase these products recognize their valuefor the kitchen as long as they are people who cook, and there is basically no disagreement aboutthat; it is a given.  So, another requirement is that, whenreceived, the public unquestioningly considers the device tobe of value.  There is never any skepticism from anyone,but when the Apple Watch is brought up people askopenly what the value is.
The product manufacturer has to carry the objective of helping people with the product.  If the intention is to helppeople just to get something for the company (sales), the product will not meet the iPod test.

Here is the test asked on the iPod itself.

"In the 2000s, how does the iPod help a person compared
to the current situation and what value does it provided him or her?"
	- In the 2000s, the only way to play 
	albums of music was by carrying around
	many CDs placing one or more into a CD player, either
	portable or stationary, and they took up a relatively large amount
	of space. The iPod made it possible to carry around
	hundreds of albums in the person's pocket. As a result,
	the person did not need to worry about keep track a binderof CDs.
	
What is important to note is that there are many products
that incidentally or accidentally feature a helpful aspect
and have become popular over time, but they are not in the same category.  At the same time, what may not be recognized by the company is what truly draws users to the product
when it is successful financially--  meaning that the founders don't truly understand what is making people use the product they work on.  And as long as they do not remove the inadvertent aspects that are essential to people using it, they will continue to succeed financially but this is not the same as passing the iPod test.  
So, the product may not be pleasant to use overall, it may havesome useless gimmicks, but it will nevertheless
carry with it a helpful aspect that makes people use it, andthe founders may not have realized that helpful aspect wasthere, unlike the devices that are designed to be helpful from the start.
The people who built a software product might be engaged in writing a thing in software and so somethingcame out of it, but not necessarily something good as a whole. 
The most prominent example of this is social media,
where the early histories of these websites started with somethingtrivial, something other than what people find it helpful for today.
In reality, social media is popular because it helps users track people they know, contact people they don't know, express their opinions to their audience and
inform their audiences of what they are doing, but none of this was
a direct and stated founding objective of the founders of any of the most
popular social media companies in the earliest days when they began.Not one had proper intentions from the start and had insteadaccidental success. Going back to the earliest social media websites,the people involved were not trying to do anything for anyone at the outset, they were not intending to provide a product to solve a problem.  An iPod is trying to help the person carry around music in a portable and convenient way.  For the social media websites, the helpfulaspects became apparent shortly after the websites were built and utilized,
set up with different intentions.  Thus, a crucial aspect of moving from the present warped and confused technology industry into the future is the recognition that many business successes result from incidental features that were not part of the startup plan.  They do not pass the iPod test,
which ensures that a technology product is solid and complete,
like the iPhone or iPad or the all-or-nothing crowdfunding industry.

To pass the iPod test, a product's general usage by the consumer
has to be predicted ahead of time at the outset of the product'sinception.  Of course, it is sometimes interesting when consumers branch
out into unusual or unexpected uses of a product, but this is seen as
unnecessary.  What is important is that the main thesis of a product
is validated by its reception.  A product has to have a thesis at the outset.
Social media did not ever have a thesis (why and how people would
use it in general) whereas all-or-nothing crowdfunding did.  Becauseit did not, the public latched onto the useful aspects that were therewhile getting hurt by the whole of the websites and their tendencyto replace purpose with encouraging base social habits in people.

The uses of all-or-nothing crowdfunding were all predicted
in advance and example use cases were provided to the
consumers that would guide them into use cases
that they would actually find helpful for their goals.
