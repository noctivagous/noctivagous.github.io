My browser extension that I prototyped
just over a year ago, called NPSurfer, 
passed the iPod test.  I found myself using it 
every day, and when it was missing I wished it was there.

I call it "The iPod Test" because it is the requirement
a consumer product can be measured by: 
do you want to use it regularly because you find it to be helpful?  
How does it help you? Is it ever something of great value to you?  
The electric pressure cooker passes the iPod test
and, viewing it without having used one, so does 
the air fryer.


The iPad and iPhone passed this test as well (but not
just because they carry the same capabilities as the iPod).  
However, XR devices have not met the standard for this,
demonstrating the need to discuss the subject.

Discussing each consumer product in terms of answering the question,
"how does this product help a person and what value
does it provide him or her?"  The product manufacturer
has to have the objective of helping people and the intention
has to be out of benevolence.  If the intention is to help
people to get something (sales), the product will not
meet the iPod test.

Here is the question asked on the iPod itself.
In the 2000s, how does the iPod help a person compared
to the current situation and what value does it provided him or her?
	- Currently in the 2000s, the only way to play 
	albums of music is by carrying around
	many CDs placing them into a CD player, either
	portable or stationary, and this is inconvenient
	because they take up a relatively large amount
	of space. The iPod makes it possible to carry around
	hundreds of albums in the person's pocket. As a result,
	the person does not need to worry about losing 
	an binder of CDs.
	
What is important to note is that there are many products
that incidentally or accidentally feature a helpful aspect
and have become popular anyway. At the same time, 
this may not be recognized as what truly draws users to the product
even as the owners of the company are successful financially,
meaning that the founders don't truly understand what is
making people use the product they work on and as long as
they do not remove the inadvertent aspects that are essential
to people using it, they will continue to benefit financially.  
So, the product will not be pleasant to use overall but will nevertheless
carry with it a helpful aspect that makes people use it.
This can occur because the people who built the software product 
were engaged in writing a thing in software at all. 
The most prominent example of this is social media,
where the early histories of these websites started with
something other than what people find it helpful for.
In reality, social media helps users track people they know, contact
people they don't, express their opinions to their audience, and
inform their audiences of what they are doing, but none of this was
a direct and stated founding objective of the founders of any of the most
popular social media companies when they began, going back to
the earliest social media websites.  Rather, these helpful
aspects became apparent shortly afterwards.  Thus,
a crucial aspect of moving from the present, warped and confused 
technology industry into the future is the recognition that many business 
successes result from incidental features that were not
part of the plan.  They do not pass the iPod test.

To pass the iPod test, a product's general usage by the consumer
has to be predicted ahead of time in  at the
very beginning.  Of course, it is beneficial that consumers branch
out into unusual or unexpected uses of a product, but this is seen as
bonus compared to the importance of the main thesis of a product
being validated by its reception.  A product has to have a thesis.
Social media did not ever have a thesis (why and how people would
use it in general) whereas all-or-nothing crowdfunding did.

The uses of all-or-nothing crowdfunding were all predicted
in advance and example use cases were provided to the
consumers that would guide them into realistic activities
they would actually find helpful to their goals.
