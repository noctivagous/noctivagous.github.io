Triadic

Thesis:

Patterns of the world can be assembled 
into triads and then the application
of techniques like combinatorics and hypergraph
can describe a wide range of phenomena, 
even produce sentence grammar.  This
document discusses the foundation
and not entirely the technique.

For concept names, triads are found everywhere from
Electricity:  Watts, Volts, Amps 
States of Matter: Solid, Liquid, Gas
Thermodynamics: Pressure, Volume, Temperature.
Dimensions: Length, Width, Height

But also, the condition of the whole can
be assessed according to Taiji:

  Excess, Deficiency, Equilibrium

with generic triads degrees,

  Low, Medium, High

  Small, Medium, Large
  
  Mild, Moderate, Severe

The whole of things has phases:

  Formation, Stasis, Degeneration
 
  Beginning, Middle, End

Journey Evaluation:

  Progress, Regress, Stasis    

Affected

  Beneficial, Harmful, Neutral     

  Short-term, Long-term, Immediate



at locations

  interior, exterior, border  
  inside, outside, opening
  internal, external, boundary
  
perceived material states:

  Solid, Liquid, Gas

phases of them

  into [e.g. solid], out of [e.g. gas], stays [liquid]
  



The structure

  Part, Component, Whole


For dissecting events or decisions into triadic categories
and making sentences too.


COMBINATIONS OF THREES

ternary (three-way) distinctions

A triad always come with a label because a label assists in sentence-making. 

"An unusually high temperature" from Temperature: (Low,Medium,High),
Range: [Normal, Unusual, Undetermined] and other labeled triads. 
It's just that (Low,Medium,High) are a generic triad that is reused for other labels,
such as Height.  All that needs to be added is "Height" to this generic
triad.

Combinatoric Storage 

Example with [High, Medium, Low].

Medium AND Low -> Medium-Low

    Storage with order.
    
Medium-Low (0, 1).   Low-Medium






Token-Like Processing

Tokens capture portions and new relationships
The triad "Part-Component-Whole" and related 
allow for token-like processing of sentences,
word fragments, and errors.

Switching from “nested dicts + decision trees” to a hypergraph makes the system
efficient:

- truly combinatorial without explosion
- fully auditable
naturally extensible
- able to generate sentences, decisions, and explanations from the same structure

So: External Stasis.  Beneficial Stasis.
Harmful Progress. 


Reuse and efficiency:  

Triads like "High, Medium, Low"
"Short, Medium, Long" can exist in data
as generic triads. They have multiple 
labels associatable with them,
just like Mild, Moderate, Severe
And yet the labels are an opportunity
for another aspect of connectedness.

1. Ambiguity & Error Triads

The jump from “someone hands it pre-classified triads” to “throw any sentence or paragraph at it and get clean, auditable triad output” is mostly four new pieces.

Triad name,State 1,State 2,State 3,Purpose
Clarity,Clear,Ambiguous,Contradictory,Detects self-contradiction or vagueness
Parsing-Confidence,High,Medium,Low,How sure the classifier is
Completeness,Full,Partial,Missing-Critical,Did we get the key elements?
Source-Reliability,Trusted,Unverified,Dubious,Provenance of the text
Polarity-Resolution,Resolved,Multi-Polar,Unresolvable,Multiple plausible interpretations
Error-Handling,Proceed,Clarify,Reject-Input,What the system must do right now




For storage of knowledge concepts, triads (groups of three interconnected elements) appear across many domains. Here are some classic examples:

- Electricity: Voltage (V), Current (I), Resistance (R) → related by Ohm’s law: V = I × R
- Power triangle: Watts (P), Volts (V), Amps (I) → P = V × I (for DC); with power factor in AC
- States of matter: Solid, Liquid, Gas (plus Plasma as a fourth in some contexts)
- Thermodynamics: Pressure, Volume, Temperature → linked by the ideal gas law PV = nRT
- Color models:
  - Additive (light): Red, Green, Blue (RGB)
  - Subtractive (pigment): Cyan, Magenta, Yellow (CMY)
- Primary colors in art (traditional): Red, Yellow, Blue
- Forces in physics: Often mass, acceleration, force (F = ma)
- Time: Past, Present, Future
- Human needs (basic triad): Food, Water, Shelter
- Rock-paper-scissors: Three options in perfect cyclic balance
- Logic/philosophy: Thesis, Antithesis, Synthesis (Hegelian dialectic)
- Religion/theology: Father, Son, Holy Spirit (Christian Trinity); Brahma, Vishnu, Shiva (Hindu Trimurti)
- Dimensions: Length, Width, Height
- Audio: Bass, Midrange, Treble
- Nutrition macronutrients: Carbohydrates, Proteins, Fats
- Traffic lights: Red, Yellow, Green
- Government branches (USA): Legislative, Executive, Judicial








1. Discernment Triad (Beneficial/Harmful/Neutral): Values clear-eyed evaluation without false positives/negatives—truth as the foundation, rejecting naive optimism or cynicism. This grounds ethics in net utility.

2. Dynamics Triad (Progress/Regress/Stasis): Anchors a bias toward forward motion but respects equilibrium; values sustainable advance over reckless change, echoing evolutionary fitness.

3. Agency Triad (Action/Contemplate/Idle): Prioritizes calibrated response—do when ready, think when unclear, pause to avoid waste. This embeds stoic wisdom: control what you can (Internal), react wisely to what you can't (External).


AI: Stacking these triads multidimensionally creates a rule-based AI architecture—think a combinatorial state machine rivaling NNs but fully transparent, auditable, and deterministic. It could be like a hypercube of decisions: Intake (Beneficial/Harmful/Neutral) × Outcome (Progress/Regress/Stasis) × Location (Internal/External/Both) feeds into your Action/Contemplate/Idle table, then chains with Cause (Known/Tentative/Unknown) and Confidence (High/Medium/Low) to output behaviors. 
It parses any input into crisp vectors—no black-box gradients needed. Extend to "Memory" (Recall/Forget/Update) or "Ethics" (Self/Others/Balance), and you've got a full agent: e.g., External Harmful Progress + Low Confidence + Others priority → Contemplate (Map) → Simulate countermeasures.

Implementation's straightforward in code—a nested dict lookup or decision tree:







Start with seed meta-triads:
- Abstraction Level: Atomic/Composite/Systemic
- Time Horizon: Immediate/Near/Future  
- Stakeholder: Self/Ally/Adversary
