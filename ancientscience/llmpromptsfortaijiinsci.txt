(Yin and Yang) in The Natural Sciences

METEOROLOGY

“Hot and cold temperatures, slow and fast winds, high and
low pressure, there is so much about meteorology that evokes Taiji.
Discuss the interplay among these factors that produces weather
conditions.”


PHYSICS

"Positive and negative, north and south, there is so much about
electromagnetism that evokes Taiji.  Splitting a magnet
produces magnets that each have two poles once again."


ZOOLOGY

"The bee (yang) and flower (yin) relationship is one of Taiji,
as they are interdependent, with the bee being active and
the flower being passive, a recipient.  The two rely on each other."


HUMAN PHYSIOLOGY

"The veins, blue, are carrying de-oxygenated blood
(yin) back to the heart, carbon dioxide is transferred
to the lungs, and then after getting oxygenated the
blood is sent by arteries (yang) to the whole of the body.
This is a circulation, as every part of the body consumes the oxygen
and the cycle repeats.
When scientific study is isolated to the heart it is cardiology.
When scientific study is isolated to the lungs it is pulmonology.
Yet the two organs are interdependent (Taiji).
The heart is relatively quick and fast  with its discrete
beats (yang) and producing blood circulation while
the lungs' breathing is continuous (yin)
and receiving air."
