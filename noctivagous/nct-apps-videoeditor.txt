LAYOUTS

1. Grid View

    The timeline is laid out on a set
    of rows and viewing the timeline
    is a matter of vertical scrolling,
    allowing the editor to see more of
    the composition on screen at a time.  

    The cells are an organization convention.    
    Each grid cell corresponds to
     a block of time according
    to the current scale, e.g. 1 minute.
    Therefore, a grid shown with 
    rows 5 blocks (cells) wide 
    would then have 5 minutes shown per row.
    
    Option: Clips always snap side to side without
    gaps.  Any gaps on the timeline require
    a spacer, title, or transition to be inserted.

    Playhead follows either
      - Row-major order: 
     left-to-right, top-to-bottom.
        - scrolling is vertical
        for fixed column count (until resize).

      -Column-major order:
      Top-to-bottom, left-to-right
        - scrolling is horizontal
        for fixed row count (until resize).

    Clips are added into
    empty slots on a grid.
    A clip may end up spanning more than
    one slot or only take up a portion.
     

2. Rectangular Spiral View


The timeline is a rectangular spiral
and the playhead starts from the top left
and moved around clockwise until it reaches
the center.  There is a gap between
each level of the spiral.

    playback modes:
        a) running filmstrip, stationary playhead frame -
        all frames of the timeline 
        run across the rectangular spiral like
        a conveyor belt, at a
        provided scale.
        
        b) stationary (portion) filmstrip, with moving playhead
        the timeline shown on the rectangular
        spiral is a portion of the clip.
            - allows using the rectangular spiral
            for trimming clips and seeing more frames
        
       


3. Fullscreen Playback Imposition Grid

end, is shown in a grid fitting as many
