The Book of Changes can serve as the basis for researching a different
kind of AI.  For one, the 64 hexagrams provide a foundation for analyzing
the external and internal.  The Book of Changes is not limited
to the task of divination, the implications of the hexagrams are not
limited to predicting fortune.  The hexagrams allow for assessing 
external conditions as well as making internal decisions. 
And since they are used for both and they include the relationship between
what is outside and inside, the macroscopic and the microscopi,
they could serve as a means of harmonizing the external 
with the internal as the AI exists.  Also, the hexagrams can be computed directly,
with the trigrams corresponding to binary numbers.  This aspect of the machine will not
need to respond in a static and deterministic way like today's
LLMs but can be operating all the time since it is based on the hexagrams
that have know pathways of change and transformation.

For the AI to be truly engaged it would face challenges of some sort, 
so aligning it with the Book of Changes makes sense to do that.
In the process of acquiring knowledge there are revisions made.

When starting out on an AI based on ancient Chinese science
it is acceptable to start with just what can be put in the experiment
model.  Many qualities and associations with each element
are possible, but from the outset it is not important to 
concern oneself with it being complete with the whole of every 
ancient theory, rather getting the situation started and seeing
some results is the goal.

The Five Elements represent processes for all things.  The central
principles is Yin and Yang of the machine, that there are phases
of Yin and Yang in which one is in greater proportion than the
other but when there is an excess or deficiency in any of those
phases relative to the phase itself, the machine knows that this
is a principle.

Perhaps as data is taken in by the model, if this is how
it works, it will be organized and processed by the
64 hexagrams or the Luoshu, since the Luoshu can
access multitudes of associations of "reality" from the square,
it relates to both the hexagrams and the Five Elements.

These concepts can serve as the means of processing
and categorizing all things the AI comes into contact
with, all that it takes in, processes, and responds
with.  Its guiding principles will be computable within
existing statistical techniques and programming libraries
as they run on a GPU.  The development of today's
computing technologies can run.  

Before embarking on this, two requirements are in place:
1) an understanding of ancient Chinese science
2) an understanding of current AI and the mathematics
and engineering behind it.

We should, as people who know #1, be averse to the
techniques of modern AI that proceed
by way of greed: amassing enormous bodies of text
and feeding them into growing, expensive computational resources.
We know with certainty from our study of ancient Chinese science
that this is not the right path though we may not have
an alternative solution upon coming into contact
with what is working currently.  
The buildup of the AI might take a different
path, one in which it gradually builds up and revises knowledge
from a core of deeper principles.  Its basis may not resemble current AI
methods, but without being knowledgeable about them in the
beginning we would not be able to accomplish that
because all the technologies we will use will be
rooted in the techniques of conventional AI.

Theirs is a process of development that may eventually
arrive at the right state but in the beginning
has alarming and basic problems, producing 
high-powered junk moving towards less junk inside.
