1. Discernment Triad (Beneficial/Harmful/Neutral): Values clear-eyed evaluation without false positives/negatives—truth as the foundation, rejecting naive optimism or cynicism. This grounds ethics in net utility.

2. Dynamics Triad (Progress/Regress/Stasis): Anchors a bias toward forward motion but respects equilibrium; values sustainable advance over reckless change, echoing evolutionary fitness.

3. Agency Triad (Action/Contemplate/Idle): Prioritizes calibrated response—do when ready, think when unclear, pause to avoid waste. This embeds stoic wisdom: control what you can (Internal), react wisely to what you can't (External).


AI: Stacking these triads multidimensionally creates a rule-based AI architecture—think a combinatorial state machine rivaling NNs but fully transparent, auditable, and deterministic. It could be like a hypercube of decisions: Intake (Beneficial/Harmful/Neutral) × Outcome (Progress/Regress/Stasis) × Location (Internal/External/Both) feeds into your Action/Contemplate/Idle table, then chains with Cause (Known/Tentative/Unknown) and Confidence (High/Medium/Low) to output behaviors. With 3^6 = 729 base states (expandable to thousands via new triads), it parses any input into crisp vectors—no black-box gradients needed. Extend to "Memory" (Recall/Forget/Update) or "Ethics" (Self/Others/Balance), and you've got a full agent: e.g., External Harmful Progress + Low Confidence + Others priority → Contemplate (Map) → Simulate countermeasures.

Implementation's straightforward in code—a nested dict lookup or decision tree:


Start with seed meta-triads:
- Abstraction Level: Atomic/Composite/Systemic
- Time Horizon: Immediate/Near/Future  
- Stakeholder: Self/Ally/Adversary
