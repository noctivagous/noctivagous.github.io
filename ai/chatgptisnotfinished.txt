ChatGPT Isn't Finished (Made into a
Software Application Suite);
It's a Simple Textbox Interface to an API

ChatGPT (GPT4) offers a lot of capabilities but the actual situation
is that it is just a superficial website gateway-- a plain text box-- 
for what OpenAI engineered for the computer data centers.   Originally 
OpenAI was just focused on selling access to that technical API (the API 
that communicates to the LLM in the data centers).  Then it put together 
this "chat" format on a web page to interact with the API.  The API's
responses are stacked up vertically after the user sends out text to the API.

According to official accounts,  ChatGPT is an accidental success; 
OpenAI originally released it as a "research preview". They had no 
intention of marketing it commercially.  But then the public's interest 
in the user-friendly interface to GPT3 exceeded expectations. This is according to their 
own version of events.

The ChatGPT style of web interaction with AI was possible earlier, of course, and 
there were consumers in previous years requesting an opportunity to chat 
for free with an AI in this way, because all of the available options 
cost money.  Fortunately, OpenAI provided an opportunity for people 
interested in AI to try out interacting with their API for free, 
without needing to write a program to make use of the GPT3 API.  
OpenAI also succeeded with ChatGPT because it provided a high-quality 
LLM, this GPT3 and later GPT4. 

But what OpenAI may not realize is that, as an organization, it only
has hired personnel to work on one side of the situation, the engineering 
of the AI in the data centers, and they do not have a team intent 
on completing the ChatGPT app into something finished, resembling a 
completed suite of features (like an iLife app, such as GarageBand).  
The natural evolution of ChatGPT would lead to this, for interacting 
with an LLM can go beyond writing text from scratch every time in a 
one-line box, something that gets tiresome after a while (always writing 
from scratch the commands).  That is to say, ChatGPT isn't a suite of tools and 
OpenAI stopped at the text box that sends API calls, with the page 
stacking the responses as a "chat".

ChatGPT just provides a simple interface to the GPT's raw API that, 
previously, few people except experienced programmers could use.  
The "research preview" transformed the situation by satisfying lay 
demand for free access to AI, but it wasn't built out beyond that, it isn't a 
complete software package with a full, developed app experience, 
with ways to access all of the use cases and scenarios of an LLM. 
It's very basic, as it's not even possible to collapse or hide 
any of the chat output from ChatGPT.
There are no nodes (patches) a person can wire up to control its responses 
(such as what is found in Unreal Engine's Blueprints). Some people in the AI community 
have come up with their own independent apps with this feature for 
interfacing to LLMs, especially the image generators.
 
Apart from a text box, there is nothing guiding the user for how to 
use ChatGPT, either.  When we say that ChatGPT needs to be built into an app 
this means that ChatGPT doesn't have any menus, toolbars, panels, 
presets, templates, or generic prompts.  It isn't a finished app 
because it isn't any kind of lifestyle or productivity app. So, there is no way the public can 
find this tool useful for very long unless OpenAI finishes the software.

At the most basic level, what ChatGPT needs is not just a few specific 
examples to click on such as "Come up with a trip itinerary for me to 
visit____" but instead a generic prompts: "Come up with a ___" or "Make 
an outline for ___".  Then these would be grouped into categories of 
use as well, such as for daily life, research, quizzing, etc.

Finally, typing text is not always the strongest means of controlling 
an LLM at all times, because it depends on the use case.  If it is 
DALL-E, then there should be pre-configured controls (such as the 
node-based programming nodes) with adjustable parameters.
