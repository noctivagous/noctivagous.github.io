Guideline-Centric Box Sizing And Layout - Flexible Guideline Net

-- Guidelines Act As Programmatic Elements That 
Hold Boxes, Both on Their Edges and Centerlines.

	- What is Programmed Are The Behavior of The Guidelines
	in particular through parameters.
	
-- Boxes are assigned to guidelines.

-- For a box to have size and position it has to be 
assigned to 4 guidelines corresponding to its edges.
	- The top and bottom edges of a box are therefore assigned to 
	horizontal guidelines while the left and right
	are assigned to vertical guidelines.

-- Guidlines are defined relative to the parent box to which
they belong, with the viewport being the root box.

-- Because guidelines can move in either fixed or dynamic relationships
to box edges, this allows for ordered, flexible layouts without the use
of constraints components.
	
- Guidelines - vertical and horizontal (diagonal later) 
are specified manually, but since they are programmatic
elements, their position is configured through parameters.

	- Guidelines are positioned inside or outside of the box.

Presets for a box's guidelines are possible, such as 
three column layouts with gutters.
