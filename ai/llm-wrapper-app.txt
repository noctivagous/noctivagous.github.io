A More Versatile LLM Wrapper App Is How
Current AI Technology Can Be Adopted By The
Mainstream

A wrapper app for an LLM ought to be provided that goes
beyond the basic AI chatbot formula in which the user
is only given a freeform textbox and is confined to
typing out prompts from scratch.

The new user is planted in front of the textbox and then
instructed, "now go! ask for whatever you want!" 
which sounds great at first, like interacting with a genie
in a bottle.  Noctivagous takes the view that the 
"genie in a bottle" direction for current AI technology
is misguided, the fantasy that the person will kick back
on a couch, say a few things. and get exactly what he or she desires,
and then it is the job of the AI community to arrive at this
point.

The AI chatbot's text box amounts to an unfinished situation
in which the user starts from scratch each time with prompts,
writing everything out all over again, writing original
prose and complete sentences for every situation, which
is exhausting and incompatible with mainstream adoption ofAI.  

Even when the use of the LLM would benefit by suggesting
developed categories of usage with presets and parameters,
it is just the textbox that is provided and then supposedly the
research will make interactivity better and better.  Computers
and AI are tools, though, and this isn't likely to change today.

To see how unfinished the chatbot formula is, in the typical
web app when text is pasted and the return key pressed, it 
abruptly scrolls the whole window contents, exposing raw
that it is a generally primitive app situation hooked into
massively developed AI computers.  

To address the limitations of the AI chatbot trend,
this future app should seek to provide an application suite 
of prompt-making functionality, crafted by the product makers
according to how people generally try or could use an LLM.  
Since an LLM is so versatile, it should have tools that reflect
this, providing a kind of notebook or menu, allowing the
user the opportunity to select how it should be used.
The goal is to allow the user to produce the prompts
rapidly by providing UI sections and categories with
premade parameters and settings and also software features
specific to various categories.  

Categories and app menu sections include the following.
The first is the most freeform and could be named that.

1) (Default) Continue/Comment On/Make Response to (provided text).
2) Inquiry/Explain a Subject (generate a profile or background on a topic).   Provide reading list for subject.
3) Manufacture/Generate Text: literature, poem, essay, possible business names, according to specs.  
4) Programming Code.  Operations, Generate Code, Answer Question.
5) How-to (how to do a thing).  Solutions for a Problem.  Practical Skills.  Everyday Reference.
6) Veracity check (find out if something is true generally).
7) Explain provided text.  It's Origin / It's meaning
8) Data:  Generate Data (e.g. weather for a region).  Reformat provided data.
Check for condition in provided data/text.  Analyze.
9) Converse, Simulate Interaction: role-playing, simulated interviews,
language learning, and other interactive sessions designed to mimic real-life interactions.
10) Education: Typical course curriculum for a subject.  Describe prerequisites.

The interface for an LLM should be multifaceted, not limited to what theuser can come up with but stand alone as a presentation of pathways for any userwho approaches.  Each pathway, each destination has its own utilities builtin.  When the LLM is made use of for reading old texts, for example, it has traditionalsoftware functionality provided for that purpose, for paginating
what is pasted, for treating a PDF as a book, for highlighting text, etc.This is in contrast to the AI chatbot that has little recognition when anycommon and specific usage occurs apart from writing code.

In contrast to "chat", this will bring out far more genuine
possibilities of the common LLM inside an app suite, an
app providing the user traditional controls and functions, and menus.
It will allow the LLM to break out of
a vertical chat format, as at times there may be an interest
to generate responses on a grid flowing from left
to right, to see iterations.  If the LLM is used to generatespecific kinds of data, the presentation of the generated outputshould be changeable, just like described, so that it isn't alwaysraw text.
Directing the output of the LLM
is valuable when AI is viewed as a more advanced tool
rather than a genie in a bottle.

In an app like this, menus divide interactivity with the LLM into
categories that assist the user in generating prompts according
to the needs when the LLM is used.  Providing starting points for the LLM
for the user will end up being far more productive than a bare text box, which
is probably too simplistic and tiresome when there is
such a wide range of situations for which a person might use an LLM
and such a large number of instances when the prompts could be
formulated with convenient, traditional app user interface.
At the current time, this is not regarded as a concern as there is
belief that AI technology is advancing so rapidly that the tool
just described will be obsolete as soon as it is finished in a year or
two.  That may not be true in the end.

A weak point of the AI chatbot is that interacting with the LLM
often involves a lot of repetition and revision of writing and typing
but there are no functions provided for that or even something to
formulate prompts generatively in the first place.  
The presets within each category will facilitate valuable
usage of the LLM for that individual category.

An LLM wrapper app like this demonstrates product development
that extends beyond the basic AI chatbot because it works with
the LLM with more developed interactive conveniences and it shows
that product is not obsolesced by research and engineering but
should continue to be discussed.

Currently the textbox for an AI chatbot is freeform typing.
Offering some organization and structure to the situation--
laying down a kind of blueprint for the amusement park--
will make the LLM a lot more useful for the consumer.
It is only under these conditions when an LLM could
become mainstream.



-----

1) Continue/Comment On/Make Response to: This would enable users to
build upon or have the LLM respond to existing text, whether it's their own or
provided by the LLM, fostering interactive.  Dialectical benefits for
the user of the LLM which is that there is the ability to see
a broader view of the topic by having the LLM response.


2) Inquiry/Explain a Subject: Users could utilize the LLM
to research and generate informative profiles or backgrounds
on a wide range of topics, as well as receive curated reading
lists to further explore those subjects.

3) Manufacture/Generate Text: This would allow users
to generate various types of written content,
from literature and poetry to business name ideas and essays,
based on specified parameters or prompts.
The LLM could draw upon its broad knowledge to produce
 high-quality, original text tailored to the user's needs.
 
4) Programming Code: This section would enable
users to leverage the LLM's capabilities for
software development, including generating code,
answering programming-related questions, and
even performing various code operations like
refactoring, optimization, or debugging.

5) How-to and Solutions for Problems: This feature would allow users to
obtain step-by-step instructions or solutions for a variety of
tasks and challenges, drawing on the LLM's extensive knowledge
and problem-solving abilities.  Especially relevant to household
tasks, home improvement, automotive repair, questions about
machines, appliances, etc.

6) Veracity Check: Users could use this feature to assess the
truthfulness or accuracy of claims, information, or statements,
leveraging the LLM's understanding of factual knowledge and its
ability to cross-reference sources.  Primarily valued for
circumstances relating to factuality outside of contemporary
controversies.

7) Explain Provided Text: Users could leverage this feature to gain
insights into the origin, meaning, and context of a given text,
helping to deepen their understanding.  Especially useful for
older texts.  Translation, summarizing, etc. for provided texts
falls under this category.

8) Data Generation and Analysis: The LLM could be used to generate,
format, and analyze various types of data, from weather forecasts
to statistical insights, providing users with valuable information
and insights from data.

9) Converse, Simulate Interaction: This section would allow users
to engage in more immersive and interactive experiences, such
as role-playing, simulated interviews, and language learning
exercises, helping to bridge the gap between the LLM and real-world interactions.


10) Education: The LLM could be utilized to provide information on typical course
curricula for different subjects, as well as describe the prerequisites and
other relevant details to support educational and learning goals.
Test questions and quizzes can be generated in this section.
