Obstacle to Cooking: Having To Think About It


The appeal of frozen dinners and eating out
goes beyond convenience.  It is that cooking
food as a meal requires "context switching"
in the middle of activity.

When you eat out, you don't have to think
about the cooking of the meal, just point
to the item on the menu.  With a frozen dinner, 
you don't have to either.
You just pull something from the freezer
and put it in the microwave.
In these cases, you don't have to compose 
the recipe, gather the ingredients, or set up a cooking
device.  They don't interrupt you and
in some cases you can contemplate other
matters, such as at a restaurant.

There is the other issue which is the
waiting for the meal to be finished
and the procedures required to
set up the equipment and put it away
doesn't always fit into the schedule
of activities for the day, whether the 
person is willing and interested in 
cooking or not.  Even to cook rice 
requires setting the rice cooker,
waiting for it to be finished, and
then cleaning the rice cooker's bowl.

So, for this kind of person, if a prepared 
meal is going to be healthy, it either has 
to come from a healthy line of frozen dinners 
or a healthy restaurant, because the
cooking is too involved at the moment
it has to be done.

There can be another option which is
to use the frozen packages and combine
them on the spot in the microwave.

- First, the most simple is just
to add chopped pieces of tofu in
a bowl of brown rice that was
microwaved from the frozen pouch,
then adding soy sauce.

- An asian stir-fry package has
cut vegetables in it. A portion
of the package is combined with 
a pouch of brown rice in the 
bowl placed into the microwave.
-- This is still really good because
it is as if the person cut vegetables
and put them in rice.
-- Soy sauce and other spices
or oil can be added afterwards
but this is a fast, healthy,
and basic meal that is composed
quickly.

The not-having-to-think-about-it
comes from knowing that the brown
rice is the base and the other part
is the topping or complement.

- A can or jar of garden vegetable 
soup is ok to prepare by itself
but goes well completely or partly
placed on top of a pouch of
frozen brown rice and placed in
the microwave.  In 3.5 minutes
a dish is ready that might only
need pepper and some salt or
other seasoning, if wanted.

This is a style of cooking that
appeals to the person willing to
eat in a simple way, but it is
effective.

Ingredients sit around that can
be combined with the base, like
rice.

- Salsa, canned beans, vegetable broth
placed into a bowl and microwaved.
