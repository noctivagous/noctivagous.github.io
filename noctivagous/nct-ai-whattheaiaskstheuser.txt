FOR AI CHATBOT SOFTWARE

-------

different types of clarifying questions.

    scenario: the user talks about a thing with text. the user then asks the ai
    to do a thing with the text provided or respond to it.

questions:

- for understanding what the user was saying.  "Did you mean...?"
     
- for understanding what the user wanted the ai to do in the request.
    - resolving ambiguity.  "When you asked me to ... did you mean...?"
    - gathering details on issues the user didn't specify or realize
    "How do you want me to..."

WHAT INFORMATION IS BEING ASKED FOR

Clarifying questions vs. Information gathering

If the user doesn't know what needs to be provided
to achieve a task, the AI will, in the process of clarifying
the task, collect that information from the user.

This might be different that the separate task of collecting
information, such as to get specifics about how to do
something like set up a software development project, which
has many details.
Each task has a different scope and some have unlimited
details that can be filled in.

THE DIFFERENT TYPES OF RESPONSES THE AI PROVIDES

There is a difference between

    - a conversational answer from the AI (can be put into the chat conversation).
        - the user has asked the AI what it can and cannot do or what it did, etc.
        - AI affirms or briefly answers a query.
    
    - the product of a task carried out by the AI (should be put into output pane).
        - code generated.
        - a translation made.
        - a research summary.
        
"If you are fulfilling a request that produces output such as code or text
like an article or translation, put the output in the output pane.
If you are answering a question.


--> Special UI.  The output pane's default view is thumbnail and not the
full output.  It is also 1/2 to 1/3 the width of the converstaion column.  
Another view for the output pane is accordion. When the output placed into 
the output pane is represented as an image thumbnail, clicking a thumbnail 
displays the full output spanning the whole window viewport as an overlay.

PREVIEW BEFORE CONFIRMATION OF ACTION TO TAKE

"Here is what I am planning to do"

In the response:

For a code addition for the project, in the response's
left column it says "Here is what I am planning to do:" followed
by a list underneath and in the right column there are
accordion items of each code section that will be added
or removed, including which document it pertains to.
