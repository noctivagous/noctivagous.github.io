Kiosks And Maps Are Missing From Retail Stores


It is now a habit to acquire to to look up
an item's aisle location online before 
you walk into a Home Depot or Wal-mart.

Why should customers eve have 
to ask employees where something
is located when the big box retail stores
could easily set up kiosk computers
throughout the store with store maps
on them and a search app?  They leave
these on the employees' mobile phones
and store computers.

Especially stores like Home Depot
or Lowes should do this.  It's
definitely something Wal-mart
and Target should do.  When
you walk in, you should come across an
overview map, just like a shopping
mall has except for the sections
of the store.  This has existed
for a long time for multi-floor department 
stores, but it is also important
for big box retail stores to have it.
