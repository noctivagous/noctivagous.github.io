.nctlayout document

Comes with a set of conventions
for sizing and laying out containers
for layouts but does not contain
document data.  At the last level
of the document can define the slot
as a text area, image, video, or
other media including id, label,
and other attributes.

role attributes allow defining
a slot's behavior. relationship tags 
set up automatic gui.

this file format can be used
by programs for print documents,
and by app kits for gui layouts.

the goal is to have visible scaffolding
of different page layout conventions
and a file format for easily laying
things out or having a program lay
them out.

multiple layouts for the pages setup
can be contained in layers in 
the document, allowing for stacked
designs, which can help with gui
design that normally has single-layer
design.  because it adheres to a grid system,
even a gui design can span multiple layers
in this document file format. for
a page design or web page, the text
may reside on one layer while there
are multiple background layers
underneath, all of which are animatable
on a web page.
