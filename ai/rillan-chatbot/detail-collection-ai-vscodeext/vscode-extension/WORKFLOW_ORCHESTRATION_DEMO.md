- User approval system for AI-suggested modifications

## ðŸš€ Available Commands

### Core Workflow Commands

1. **ðŸ”„ Start AI Workflow**
   - Command: `rillan-ai-parameter-collector.startWorkflow`
   - Starts a multi-stage workflow with AI orchestration
   - Choose from built-in templates or custom workflows

2. **ðŸ“‹ Show Active Workflows**
   - Command: `rillan-ai-parameter-collector.showActiveWorkflows`
   - View and manage currently running workflows
   - Pause, resume, cancel, or view workflow details

3. **ðŸ§ª Test Dynamic Workflow Control**
   - Command: `rillan-ai-parameter-collector.testDynamicWorkflow`
   - Demonstrates AI's ability to modify workflows in real-time
   - Shows user approval process for AI suggestions

## ðŸŽ¬ Demo Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Comprehensive Project Creation Workflow

```bash
# 1. Open Command Palette (Cmd/Ctrl + Shift + P)
# 2. Run: "Rillan AI: Start AI Workflow"
# 3. Select: "Comprehensive Project Creation"
# 4. Follow the multi-stage process:
#    - Initial Requirements (Stage 1)
#    - Technical Details (Stage 2) 
#    - Project Planning (Stage 3)
#    - Final Aggregation (Stage 4)
```

**What Happens:**
- AI guides you through 4 connected stages
- Each stage builds on previous responses
- Data is automatically aggregated
- Final results are saved and presented
- AI receives complete project specification

### Scenario 2: Investigation Workflow with Branching

```bash
# 1. Start "Comprehensive Investigation" workflow
# 2. Describe a critical issue in Stage 1
# 3. AI automatically branches to "Immediate Action"
# 4. Continue with detailed investigation
# 5. AI aggregates findings into action plan
```

**What Happens:**
- AI detects critical severity level
- Workflow automatically branches to urgent path
- Additional validation stages are added
- Investigation plan is generated based on all inputs

### Scenario 3: Dynamic Workflow Modification

```bash
# 1. Run: "Test Dynamic Workflow Control"
# 2. AI suggests adding a validation stage
# 3. Review and approve the modification
# 4. New stage is injected into workflow
# 5. Continue with enhanced process
```

**What Happens:**
- AI analyzes current workflow state
- Suggests improvements in real-time
- User approves/declines modifications
- Workflow adapts dynamically
- Enhanced data collection occurs

## ðŸ”§ Technical Architecture

### Workflow Definition Structure

```typescript
interface WorkflowDefinition {
    id: string;
    name: string;
    description: string;
    stages: WorkflowStage[];
    metadata: WorkflowMetadata;
}

interface WorkflowStage {
    id: string;
    name: string;
    type: 'form' | 'decision' | 'action' | 'aggregation';
    formRequest?: AIFormRequest;
    conditions?: WorkflowCondition[];
    nextStages?: string[];
    aggregationRules?: AggregationRule[];
}
```

### Dynamic Control Capabilities

```typescript
interface WorkflowModification {
    instanceId: string;
    type: 'add_stage' | 'modify_stage' | 'remove_stage' | 'change_flow' | 'inject_decision';
    targetStageId?: string;
    newStage?: WorkflowStage;
    reason: string;
    aiContext: ConversationContext;
}
```

## ðŸ“Š Workflow Analytics

The system tracks:
- **Stage Completion Times**: How long users spend on each stage
- **User Interaction Patterns**: Navigation and modification behaviors
- **AI Decision Accuracy**: How often AI suggestions are accepted
- **Bottleneck Detection**: Stages that cause delays or dropoffs
- **Optimization Suggestions**: AI-generated improvement recommendations

## ðŸŽ¯ Integration with Rillan Process

This implementation perfectly aligns with the Rillan process model from the reference document:

1. **Preliminary Questions**: Multi-stage form collection
2. **Plans Notification**: Workflow preview and modification approval
3. **Guided Execution**: Step-by-step orchestrated process

The AI can now:
- Collect detailed information through structured workflows
- Adapt the process based on user responses
- Maintain context across multiple interaction stages
- Provide expert-level guidance throughout the process

## ðŸ”® What This Enables

### For AI Assistants:
- **Complex Project Management**: Handle multi-week projects with structured phases
- **Adaptive Processes**: Modify workflows based on emerging requirements
- **Expert Consultation**: Provide professional-level guidance through structured processes
- **Context Preservation**: Maintain conversation context across extended workflows

### For Users:
- **Guided Experiences**: Step-by-step assistance for complex tasks
- **Flexible Processes**: Workflows that adapt to their specific needs
- **Progress Tracking**: Clear visibility into multi-stage processes
- **Quality Assurance**: Structured validation and review stages

## ðŸ§ª Testing the Implementation

### Quick Test Commands:

1. **Basic Workflow**: `Rillan AI: Start AI Workflow` â†’ Select any workflow
2. **Dynamic Control**: `Rillan AI: Test Dynamic Workflow Control`
3. **Active Management**: `Rillan AI: Show Active Workflows`

### Expected Results:

- âœ… Multi-stage forms with smooth navigation
- âœ… Automatic data aggregation between stages
- âœ… AI-driven workflow modifications with user approval
- âœ… Conditional branching based on user responses
