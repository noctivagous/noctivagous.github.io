We can use the process of landscape designer and client to improve AI, that
the AI needs to know a lot more and the AI user needs to have menus of options

The activity of working with a landscape designer provides a reference for
stages of process and interaction between the AI and the user.  It has involves
many factors that serve as a reference, as there are considerations for costs,
preferences, timelines for implementations, and more.


LANDSCAPE DESIGN

Initial Consultation is Standard:

Professional landscape designers typically start with a consultation to
understand the client’s goals, lifestyle, aesthetic preferences, and functional
needs (e.g., outdoor entertaining, low maintenance, or sustainability). Without
this, as you noted, the outcome may not reflect the client’s desires. Similarly,
AI systems like me require specific prompts to generate tailored outputs. For
example, a vague AI prompt like “design a garden” is akin to telling a designer,
“make my yard nice,” without specifying preferences for plants, layout, or
style.


Iterative Feedback:

Landscape design is often an iterative process. Designers present concepts,
sketches, or 3D renderings and refine them based on client feedback. This
mirrors effective AI use, where users refine prompts based on initial outputs.
Your scenario suggests the designer completes the project without input, which
is less common. Instead, a more accurate analogy might be a client who provides
minimal initial guidance and skips feedback rounds, leading to a final design
that feels disconnected from their vision.


Site-Specific Considerations:

Landscape design requires analyzing the property’s physical characteristics
(e.g., soil type, climate, topography, and existing vegetation). A designer
working without this data might make poor choices, like planting water-intensive
species in a drought-prone area. Similarly, AI needs context to produce relevant
results. For example, an AI prompt lacking details about climate or yard size
might suggest inappropriate plants or layouts.


Client Involvement Varies:

Busy professionals may delegate heavily, as you mentioned, but even they provide
some direction (e.g., “I want a modern, low-maintenance yard”). Without any
input, the designer’s choices might prioritize their signature style or
cost-saving measures, which may not suit the client. In AI terms, this is like
relying on default settings without customizing parameters, leading to generic
or misaligned outputs.


Post-Implementation Adjustments:

Post-installation adjustments (e.g., replacing plants or tweaking layouts) are
common but costly. This aligns with AI, where users should consider refine
prompts or edit outputs after seeing initial results, emphasizing the importance
of clear initial guidance.
