      Future Code: The Integration of Graphic Design inside Software Development Editors
      <!-- The Integration of Graphic Design into Software Development Environments-->

</h1>

    Code looks the way it does because it was established for terminal monitors
    connected to mainframe computers.  The terminals themselves had no computer
    processing power of their own.  It is these machines that set in stone
    how code would be conceived up until today, as
     most major programming languages were introduced during the 1970s and 
     early 1980s, when computer graphics hardware capabilities 
     were generally limited to these grids of terminal type characters. 
     For these computer monitors, each character had to carry the same width,
     and the monitor was laid out as a grid inside.
     
     <p>
      Afterwards, in the decades that followed, software 
      programmers found it difficult to move past monospaced type 
      as the foundational format for mainstream computer code.
      
      Yet, in the last decade there has been much more interest in adding enhancements to
      utilizing the code, such as AI copilots and GUI conveniences
      inside the code editors.  Everything is taking place except
      upgrading past the plain text itself.
    
    <p>
    This throwback appearance also persists due to
    the absence of graphic design specialists 
    who would be working alongside the computer scientists and 
    software engineers shaping software development 
    tools at various commercial enterprises. 
    The two disciplines of design and computer 
    science are too far away from each other, 
    with very few individuals carrying interests 
    or skills in both, and 
    there are few who would become involved 
    in this matter in a direct way.  
    Unfortunately, collaboration between graphic designers 
    and computer scientists will be rare until there 
    are deliberate efforts to resolve their incompatibilities.
    <p>
    There are growing signs that this is an unrecognized 
    desire amidst recent developments.  
    During the last decade, the code editor’s features for 
    interacting with computer code have been moving steadily 
    in the direction of graphic design and interactive, 
    GUI-based improvements.  Most notable lately are 
    "code completion" boxes, first becoming mainstream 
    in the 2010s and now an essential tool.  As the programmer types 
    the code in plain text, a GUI-based code completion box 
    is superimposed, driven by a background computer program, 
    pulling up analyzed suggestions for the variables or objects 
    the programmer might want to enter.
    All that needs to happen is the press of the tab key 
    to select the highlighted suggestion
    and the plain text will be inserted.  
    Arrow keys navigate up and down alternative suggestions in the GUI
    code competion menu.
    <p>    
    This demonstrates that the mainstream software development 
    community is seeking much more from code’s interactive dynamic 
    than unprocessed plain text.  Any nostalgia for the command line
    has to face up to this reality.
    But all of these methods to improve code’s appearance and user 
    interface are happening reactively. There is, officially, no change
    happening to code anywhere, just tweaks to make it better.
    But they look very substantial: 
    in any code editor of the 2020s, there is usually a “code-folding” 
    GUI built into side of the text view next to the line numbers. 
Many of these features are exposing the inadequacy of how code eixsts.

<p>
    The code-folding arrows are placed in the left margin 
     that allow collapsing or expanding sections of a plain text (.txt) 
     code file, which is a sort of upgrade without formally acknowledging
     something: plain text has a UI, it is too basic, so efforts
     are made to compensate.     These types of features are blending GUI, 
     such as the clickable code-folding arrows and the GUI-based 
     collapsing of code sections, with a file format that 
     is far away from such conventions, plain text.  
     
         <p>
     As more veneer is placed onto plain text like this, 
     what gets lost is that programmers  are 
     implying that they want to 
     interact with a formally-established document file format. 
     All of these added GUI controls and widgets relate exactly to  
     that outcome if the situation is seen for what it is.  
     In other words, code editors are moving towards, without 
     actually taking the step of doing it, the upgrade of computer 
     code’s form, away from the old terminal type.
        <p>
    If there is any remaining dispute about this, in the 2020s, 
    a large, vertical thumbnail image— called a minimap— 
    is now generated by the code editor in the right margin 
    of the file of code, for looking at the code file
     in a macro view and navigating it as a minified scroll.  
     In this case, it is the code editor making use of digital 
     image processing, taking a screen capture of the plain text file 
     (.txt) the programmer is working with, and then generating an 
     interactive control for viewing it.
        <p>
    In other areas, code is moving towards an interactive state as well. 
     Mainstream AI programmers, including the founders of OpenAI, 
     are making regular use of Jupyter Notebook, which provides an 
     interactive Python "notebook" for more flexible, 
     prototyping-style programming.  In these notebooks, 
     which are actually documents that allow Python code to be executed
     inside them, images are generated by the programming interactively,
     and not just output to a file directory where they would have
     to be manually opened.  There is a back and forth possible, 
     in response to the code entered.  
     This is in contrast to a compiled program.  
     Typing out code in plain text and then clicking a
      “build and run” button isn’t the only way to make software, 
      because with the computers of today there can be a stage that exists 
      ahead of time, which is to see the results and then modify them 
      in response.  These are the kinds of features that hired 
      interactive media and graphic designers should be involved in.
        <p>
    If a large community of the graphic designers were 
    introduced to code, as something for them to examine 
    for improvement, the topics that would come up first 
    would likely be: the absence of any page layout, the 
    lack of any meaningful organization in the code. 
     There are no headings, no outlined boxes, no columns of text. 
      There are no side columns for making notes.  And of course, 
      it isn’t even possible to embed an image inside the typical 
      programming language code file.
        <p>
    The undifferentiated appearance of a file of code, 
    and the extreme amount of screen space waste produced by 
    having only one column (newspaper page layout) of functions 
    at any time, would be obvious missed opportunities to a
     graphic designer.  But if something does not change, 
     that graphic designer or interactive media specialist 
     will not be invited by computer science professionals 
     to a code conference to intervene in the matter.  Instead, 
     code will get incremental add-ons that simply modify the 
     current situation passively, placing graphical user interfaces 
     on top of plain text.
