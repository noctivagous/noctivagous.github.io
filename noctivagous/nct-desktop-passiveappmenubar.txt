nct-desktop-passiveappmenubar

Opening an app always seems to
involve opening one of its windows.
A passive app menu bar extends
from the application icon of the Dock
and it remains until closed once opened. 
It iss a menu of functions for immediate
entry into the app's features, including
drop destination areas for files for opening
or operating on them.
An image editor might have a "convert in
place to [format]" function and dropping
a file on this drop destination
will copy a .JPG to a .PNG in its 
same directory, for example.
Other uses include immediate access
to favorite websites on a web browser
or the URL bar.  The URL bar can
extend from the Dock, in other words.
It is another access point to the
functions of a program.
