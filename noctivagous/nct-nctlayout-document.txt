.nctlayout document

a layout document file format based
on the field of print design
and uses terms within the profession.
the file format is supposed to provide 
conveniences that embed print design, such 
as a color scheme defined by one color and 
then operations produce the color scheme
(e.g., complementary, analogous, or 
monochromatic schemes), enabling rapid 
creation of professional layouts.
a web designer can make one of these 
documents with AI and immediately have a 
web page.  the beginning stage of
this is to get a layout document running
and it will provide programmatic hooks 
inside the document.

Comes with a set of conventions
for sizing and laying out containers
for layouts but does not focus on
document data.  In the <layout> part of the document 
define the slot as a text area, image, video, or
other media including id, label,
and other attributes but these don't
contain the data. document data is contained in a separate
are of the document called <documentdata>
and its tags are matched with the
corresponding ids in the layout area.

an .nctlayout document comes with defaults, 
such as a column grid with 12pt baseline
as well as hierarchy. when loaded in a viewer, if it is
empty it will show a column grid.

in a .nctlayout document, many things are
prioritized that are not on the web such
as table styling and allowing different
customizations.  standard concerns a professional
print designer has should be included.
it is usually brochure design where print
design is found using many principles
of the profession.

the buildout of the document type includes
how it will be viewed, including toggling
of different aspects and layers. the built-in
viewer for web will when asked
show a design style guide page generated 
from the document.


<nctlayout>
	<pagesetup></pagesetup>
	<layouts>
		<layout>
			<layer>
				<layoutGrids>
				<!-- corresponds to layout layer -->
				<layoutGridType premade="module"></layoutGridType>
				<layoutGridType premade="column"></layoutGridType>
				</layoutGrids>
			</layer>
		</layout>
	</layouts>
	<documentdata>
		
	</documentdata>
</nctlayout>

role attributes allow defining
a layout slot's behavior. 

this file format can be used
by programs for print documents,
and by app kits for gui layouts.

the goal is to have visible scaffolding
of different page layout conventions
and a file format for easily laying
things out or having a program lay
them out.

multiple layouts for the pages setup
can be contained in layers in 
the document, allowing for stacked
designs, which can help with gui
design that normally has single-layer
design.  because it adheres to a grid system,
even a gui design can span multiple layers
in this document file format. for
a page design or web page, the text
may reside on one layer while there
are multiple background layers
underneath, all of which are animatable
on a web page.

	allows automatic darkening and lightening of font style groups
	in the print hierarchy of the document.
	they can be automated with the typographyscale tag.
	or custom operations (e.g., darken by 10% for typography)
	
TYPOGRAPHY <typography>

	<typographyscale base-size="16pt" ratio="golden" levels="5" apply="colorscheme"/> in <features>
	
	effect: Generates font sizes (e.g., 16pt, 25.888pt, 41.856pt) 
	via JS. Map to CSS: h1 { font-size: 2.618rem; }. 
	Inherit via hierarchy (e.g., style-inherit="font-size").
	
	<typographyscale base-size="16pt" ratio="golden" levels="5"

	Supports professional print prep; hides in web view unless debugging.

BOX GENERATION <boxgeneration>
	Since the data is contained in the <documentdata> section,
	boxes can be generated according to data with 
	SEQUENCE
	
	<boxgeneration sequence="fibonacci" count="4" 
	slot-type="text"/> under <layout>. 
	Generate slots with sizes based on sequence (e.g., Fibonacci ratios).

	module

PROGRAMMATIC HOOKS <hook>
	<hook event="render" script="bindData()"/> 
	in <nctlayout> for JS callbacks, such as
	inside a button. 

LAYOUT
	a whole set of elements arranged on a layout
	
LAYER
	a layer within the layout.


TEXT STYLES <textstyle>

	incorporating print design 
	typography features that 
	manage how text flows and appears,
	particularly to prevent undesirable 
	formatting issues and ensure 
	professional presentation. 
	
	the library should implement 
	browser polyfills for advanced hyphenation and spacing control.
	 	
	widowcontrol <widowcontrol>
		In print design, a "widow" is a single word or short line at the end of a paragraph that appears alone at the top of a new page or column, creating an unbalanced look
		<widowcontrol lines="2"/> specifies that at least two lines of a paragraph must appear together at the top of a page/column to avoid widows.
		Maps to CSS widows: 2;
	
	orphancontrol <orphancontrol>
	
		<orphancontrol lines="1"/> ensures at least one line (though typically two or more) stays with the paragraph at the bottom of a page/column.
		Maps to CSS orphans: 1;,
	
	justification <justification> 
		Justification controls how text aligns within a text block. "Ragged-right" (also called left-aligned) 
		means text aligns flush left with uneven right edges, common in informal or modern print layouts 
		for readability. Other types could include justify (even edges on both sides), flush-left, flush-right, or center.
		Provides typographic flexibility to match design intent (e.g., formal justified text for books vs. ragged-right for brochures).
		<justification type="ragged-right"/>
		
		Maps to CSS text-align: left; for ragged-right. Full justification (text-align: justify;) 

		


	
	These features are common in print design 
	(e.g., books, magazines) to control 
	text block aesthetics and readability. 
	The goal is to embed these in .nctlayout’s 
	XML structure, allowing precise control 
	in print layouts while mapping to 
	web technologies (CSS) for rendering,
	with fallbacks or polyfills to handle browser limitations.
	
	
LAYOUTBOX - base class for slot and
allows nesting.  it will only render
a box with a fill and stroke.  it 
can be used by itself to assist in viewing
layouts before any media.  it is a 
placeholder for empty slots, a 
debugging tool for grid visualization.
it can be utilized or not and just
direct placement of objects instead.

	it can be laid out relative to the grid installed

TABLE for convenient layout of tables

TEMPLATE
	in keeping with the goals of convenience,
	this tag allows immediate construction of
	a layout tied to the document data section.
	the document data section can also just
	reference a file of text.

### SECTION NEEDS TO BE  UPDATED TO REFLECT ABOVE INFORMATION:

The goal is to enable nested structures that reflect print design’s visual hierarchy (e.g., headline > subhead > body) and layout hierarchy (e.g., nested grids or sections), with inheritance of properties and web rendering via HTML/CSS. The table below outlines proposed additions, their benefits for web rendering, and implementation ideas.

| Component                  | Proposed Hierarchy Additions                                                                 | Web Benefits                                                                 | Implementation Ideas                                                                 |
|----------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Overall Structure (<nctlayout>)** | Add optional <hierarchy> section to define global inheritance rules (e.g., default font or margin propagation). Allow nested <nctlayout> tags for modular sub-documents. | Supports composable layouts; aligns with web component models (e.g., Web Components). | Use XML parser (e.g., DOMParser) to process nested <nctlayout> tags. Add attributes like `inherit="font margin"` to control hierarchy behavior. |
| **Layouts and Layers**    | Support nested <layer> tags: `<layer id="parent"><layer id="child">...</layer></layer>`. Add `parent-id` attribute for relational hierarchy without nesting. | Enables multi-layered web GUIs; supports CSS animations for nested layers. | Map to nested `<div>` elements with CSS `z-index` for stacking. Use `data-parent-id` for JS-driven relationships (e.g., event delegation). |
| **Layout Grids**          | Allow nested <layoutGridType> (e.g., `<layoutGridType type="module"><layoutGridType type="column">...</layoutGridType></layoutGridType>`). Introduce <group> for logical slot grouping. | Facilitates sub-grids for responsive design; aligns with CSS Grid’s subgrid. | Render as CSS Grid with `grid-template-areas`. Use `inherit-from="parent"` for properties like `baseline-grid`. |
| **Slots and Media**       | Enable nested slots: `<slot id="parent" type="section"><slot id="child" type="text">...</slot></slot>`. Add attributes like `role="heading1"` for semantic hierarchy. | Maps to HTML semantics (<section>, <h1>); supports accessibility (ARIA roles). | Generate `<section>` or `<article>` for parent slots, `<h1>`, `<p>` for children. Use `role` to apply ARIA attributes (e.g., `aria-level="1"`). |
| **Document Data (<documentdata>)** | Support hierarchical data: `<data id="parent"><data id="child" parent-id="parent">...</data>`. Link to slots via IDs. | Enables dynamic content updates; supports nested data binding in web apps. | Use JS to map data IDs to slots (e.g., `querySelector("[data-id]")`). Support JSON-like nesting for web APIs. |
| **Features (e.g., Margins, Text Styles)** | Add inheritance attributes: `<slot style-inherit="font-family font-size">`. Define hierarchy-aware styles (e.g., `font-size` scales by level: h1 > h2). | Ensures consistent typography; mirrors print’s visual hierarchy in CSS. | Map to CSS custom properties (e.g., `--base-font-size`) with cascading rules. Use `:where([role="heading1"])` for level-specific styles. |
| **Relationships and Roles** | Use `role` attributes (e.g., `role="heading1"`, `role="body"`) to define print hierarchy. Add `relationship` tags for parent-child links (e.g., `<relationship parent="slot1" child="slot2"/>`). | Automates web interactivity (e.g., collapsible sections); enhances semantics. | Translate `role` to HTML tags (<h1>, <p>). Use JS (e.g., Alpine.js) for dynamic relationships like toggling children. |
| **Print/Web Specifics**   | Map print sizes (e.g., ISO 216 A4) to CSS units (em/rem) for web scaling. Support sequence-based hierarchies (e.g., Fibonacci for heading sizes). | Ensures print-to-web consistency; supports computational layouts. | Use `@media print` for ISO sizes, `calc()` for ratios (e.g., golden section). JS for dynamic sequence calculations. |
| **Viewer Features**       | Extend web-based viewer to display hierarchical grids (e.g., toggle baseline in yellow, module in light blue). Support hierarchy visualization (e.g., tree view). | Aids web-based editing; visualizes nested structures for designers. | Use Canvas/SVG for grid overlays. Add tree-view UI (e.g., nested <ul>) for hierarchy inspection. |

### Implementation Details
1. **XML Structure Extension**:
   ```xml
   <nctlayout>
       <pagesetup type="web" size="A4" responsive="true"/>
       <hierarchy inherit="font-family margin"/>
       <layouts>
           <layout>
               <layer id="main">
                   <layoutGrids>
                       <layoutGridType type="module">
                           <layoutGridType type="column" inherit-from="parent"/>
                       </layoutGridType>
                   </layoutGrids>
                   <slot id="section1" role="section">
                       <slot id="heading1" role="heading1" style-inherit="font-family"/>
                       <slot id="body1" role="body" parent-id="section1"/>
                   </slot>
               </layer>
           </layout>
       </layouts>
       <documentdata>
           <data id="heading1">Main Title</data>
           <data id="body1" parent-id="heading1">Body text...</data>
       </documentdata>
   </nctlayout>
   ```
   This nests a heading and body within a section, with inheritance for font styles.

2. **Web Rendering**:
   - **Parser**: Use JavaScript’s DOMParser to parse XML, generating HTML:
     ```html
     <div class="nct-root">
         <section data-id="section1">
             <h1 data-id="heading1">Main Title</h1>
             <p data-id="body1">Body text...</p>
         </section>
     </div>
     ```
   - **CSS**: Define hierarchical styles:
     ```css
     :where([role="heading1"]) { font-size: 2em; font-family: var(--base-font); }
     :where([role="body"]) { font-size: 1em; margin-left: inherit; }
     .nct-root { display: grid; grid-template-areas: "section1"; }
     ```
   - **JS**: Dynamically bind data and handle relationships:
     ```javascript
     document.querySelectorAll("[data-id]").forEach(slot => {
         const data = documentdata.find(d => d.id === slot.dataset.id);
         slot.textContent = data?.content || "";
     });
     ```

3. **Web Features**:
   - **Responsiveness**: Use CSS media queries for viewport scaling:
     ```css
     @media (max-width: 600px) {
         [role="section"] { grid-template-columns: 1fr; }
     }
     ```
   - **Accessibility**: Map roles to ARIA (e.g., `role="heading1"` → `aria-level="1"`).
   - **Interactivity**: Add JS for collapsible sections or animated layer transitions.

4. **Viewer**: Build a web app (e.g., with React or Vue) to 
toggle grids and visualize hierarchy as a collapsible tree. 
Export to HTML/CSS or PDF via jsPDF.

### Next Steps
- **Prototype**: Start with a simple JS parser to render a nested heading/body layout in a browser, using the above XML example.
- **Feedback**: If you have a sample .nctlayout file or specific print hierarchy (e.g., magazine-style with headline, subhead, columns), I can refine the structure or provide code snippets.
- **Priorities**: Should we focus on a specific aspect (e.g., typography inheritance, nested grids, or viewer UI)?
