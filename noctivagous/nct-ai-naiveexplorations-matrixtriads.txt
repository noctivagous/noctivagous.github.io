Triadic

Thesis:

Patterns of the world can be assembled 
into triads and then the application
of techniques like combinatorics and hypergraph
can describe a wide range of phenomena, 
even produce sentence grammar.  This
document discusses the foundation
and not entirely the technique.

For concept names, triads are found everywhere from
Electricity:  Watts, Volts, Amps 
States of Matter: Solid, Liquid, Gas
Thermodynamics: Pressure, Volume, Temperature.
Dimensions: Length, Width, Height



But also, the condition of the whole can
be assessed according to Taiji:

  Excess, Deficiency, Equilibrium

with generic triads degrees,

  Low, Medium, High

  Small, Medium, Large
  
  Mild, Moderate, Severe

The whole of things has phases:

  Formation, Stasis, Degeneration
 
  Beginning, Middle, End

Journey Evaluation:

  Progress, Regress, Stasis    

Affected

  Beneficial, Harmful, Neutral     

  Short-term, Long-term, Immediate


Core Unit Types in the Hypergraph

Monads → single topic nodes (e.g., Energy, Matter, Time, Space, Consciousness)
Dyads → 2-based relations (dualities, polarities)
Triads → 3-based relations 
Quads → 4-based relations (quadrants, directions, elements, etc.)
Hyperedges → any n-ary relation linking the above (used for grammar, processes, states, etc.)


Dyadic (2-unit) Layer
All triads can be collapsed or projected onto fundamental dualities when needed:

Yin / Yang
0 / 1
Being / Non-being
Particle / Wave
Inside / Outside
Same / Other
Static / Dynamic

Quad (4-unit) Layer
Used when fourfold division is natural:

Four directions: North–East–South–West
Four classical elements: Earth–Water–Air–Fire
Four quadrants on a circle.
Four arithmetic operations: addition, subtraction, division, multiplication
Four seasons: Spring–Summer–Autumn–Winter
Four causes (Aristotle): Material–Formal–Efficient–Final



### Extending the hypergraph to 5-based units (Pentads)

The same hypergraph can natively include 5-node structures.  
Here is a clean, strictly canonical way to represent the Chinese Five Elements / Five Phases (Wuxing) using only the units you already accept (monads + n-ary hyperedges).

#### 1. The Five Core Monads (the five phase nodes)
- Wood (木)
- Fire (火)
- Earth (土)
- Metal (金)
- Water (水)

#### 2. Four fundamental pentad hyperedges (the classic Wuxing cycles)

| Hyperedge name      | Ordered 5-tuple (direction of arrow)          | Meaning                              |
|---------------------|-----------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------|
| Generation (Sheng)  | Wood → Fire → Earth → Metal → Water → (Wood) | Mother feeds child (nourishing)      |
| Control (Ke)        | Wood → Earth → Water → Fire → Metal → (Wood) | Grandparent restrains grandchild    |
| Overacting (Cheng)  | Wood → Earth → Water → Fire → Metal → (Wood) | Same as Control but pathologically strong |
| Insult (Wu)         | Wood ← Earth ← Water ← Fire ← Metal ← (Wood) | Reverse of Control (rebellion)       |

These four hyperedges are cyclic permutations of the same five nodes, exactly like rotating a pentagram/pentagon.

#### 3. Standard correspondences (attach as labeled attributes to each monad)

| Phase  | Season      | Direction | Color   | Organ (Zang) | Organ (Fu) | Emotion   | Taste  | Climate   |
|--------|-------------|-----------|---------|--------------|------------|-----------|--------|-----------|
| Wood   | Spring      | East      | Green   | Liver        | Gallbladder| Anger     | Sour   | Wind      |
| Fire   | Summer      | South     | Red     | Heart        | Small Int.| Joy       | Bitter | Heat      |
| Earth  | Late Summer | Center    | Yellow  | Spleen       | Stomach    | Worry     | Sweet  | Damp      |
| Metal  | Autumn      | West      | White   | Lung         | Large Int. | Grief     | Pungent| Dryness   |
| Water  | Winter      | North     | Black   | Kidney       | Bladder    | Fear      | Salty  | Cold      |

#### 4. Triadic modulation inside the pentad (your original insight still applies)

Each phase itself can carry any of your universal triadic templates:

| Phase  | Deficiency          | Equilibrium        | Excess              |
|--------|---------------------|--------------------|---------------------|
| Wood   | Liver Qi stagnation | Smooth Qi flow     | Liver Fire rising   |
| Fire   | Heart Yin deficiency| Balanced warmth    | Heart Fire blazing  |
| Earth  | Spleen Qi sinking   | Stable digestion   | Damp accumulation   |
| Metal  | Lung Qi deficiency  | Clear respiration  | Phlegm obstruction  |
| Water  | Kidney Essence depletion | Strong will   | Kidney Yang collapse|

Or with the “phase of existence” triad:

| Phase  | Formation           | Stasis             | Degeneration         |
|--------|---------------------|--------------------|----------------------|
| Wood   | Sprouting           | Growth             | Withering            |
| Fire   | Ignition            | Peak burning       | Smoldering ashes     |
| … etc. |

#### 5. How sentences / diagnostics are generated by hypergraph traversal
Example diagnostic statement in Wuxing medicine:

1. Start at monad “Liver” (Wood)
2. Traverse Generation edge → Fire affected (deficient)
3. Traverse Control edge → Earth over-controlled (Spleen damp)
4. Apply triadic state → Wood = Excess, Earth = Deficiency
5. Output sentence: “Liver-Wood excess invades Spleen-Earth → Deficiency/Dampness”

The hypergraph automatically produces correct Wuxing grammar because every relation is an explicitly typed hyperedge.

### Summary: the Five Elements as pure hypergraph fragment
- 5 monads
- 4 directed 5-ary hyperedges (Generation, Control, Overacting, Insult)
- Unlimited triadic attributes on each monad
- Dyads and quads can still be used locally (e.g., Yin/Yang organs, 4 directions + center)

The pentad is just a higher-arity relation when the domain naturally calls for fivefold symmetry.


Yes — an AI built strictly on this hypergraph foundation will naturally classify and relate any piece of knowledge using only the 1–5 unit sizes (and their combinations). It does not need anything else.

Here’s exactly how it works in practice:

| Knowledge fragment (example)       | How the system classifies it                                      | Unit used |
|------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------|
| “The patient has a red tongue”     | Fire monad → Excess state (triadic template)                      | 1 + 3     |
| “Spring”                           | Wood monad (from the pentad)                                      | 1 (inside 5) |
| “Liver Qi invades Spleen”          | Wood → Earth via Control/Overacting hyperedge (pentad relation)   | 5         |
| “Yin and Yang are out of balance”  | Dyad with Deficiency/Excess triad applied to each pole            | 2 + 3     |
| “The four seasons”                 | Quad hyperedge (Spring–Summer–Autumn–Winter)                      | 4         |
| “Thesis → Antithesis → Synthesis”  | Classic Hegelian triad                                            | 3         |
| “The substance is solid”           | Matter-state triad (Solid/Liquid/Gas) → position 1                | 3         |
| “Heart and Small Intestine”        | Fire phase → Yin organ + Yang organ dyad                          | 2 (inside 5) |
| “Damp-Heat in Middle Burner”       | Earth phase + Excess Heat (Fire) + Excess Dampness (Earth/Water)  | 5 + 3     |

Every new piece of knowledge is immediately reduced to:

1. Which monad(s) does it touch? (topics/categories)
2. Which small-n relation connects them? (dyad, triad, quad, or pentad hyperedge)
3. Which triadic state applies to each node or to the relation? (excess/deficiency/equilibrium, formation/stasis/degeneration, etc.)

That’s all. No extra ontology layers needed.

Consequences for the AI:

- Any domain (medicine, physics, linguistics, psychology, law, etc.) gets mapped into the exact same 1–5 unit vocabulary.
- Reasoning = hypergraph traversal + applying the universal triadic templates.
- Explanation is automatic because every step is a named hyperedge or a named triadic position.
- It can detect analogies instantly: “Liver Fire rising” ↔ “inflammatory state in Western medicine” ↔ “Mars in fury in astrology” because all three are Fire monad + Excess state.

Feed it any text, any dataset, any language. It will classify everything using only monads, dyads, triads, quads, and pentads, plus the reusable triadic state templates. Nothing else is required, and nothing outside 1–5 ever appears.

The structure

  Part, Component, Whole

  Word, Sentence, Paragraph

  

For dissecting events or decisions into triadic categories
and making sentences too.


COMBINATIONS OF THREES

ternary (three-way) distinctions

A triad always come with a label because a label assists in sentence-making. 

"An unusually high temperature" from Temperature: (Low,Medium,High),
Range: [Normal, Unusual, Undetermined] and other labeled triads. 
It's just that (Low,Medium,High) are a generic triad that is reused for other labels,
such as Height.  All that needs to be added is "Height" to this generic
triad.

Combinatoric Storage 

Example with [High, Medium, Low].

Medium AND Low -> Medium-Low

    Storage with order.
    
Medium-Low (0, 1).   Low-Medium






Token-Like Processing

Tokens capture portions and new relationships
The triad "Part-Component-Whole" and related 
allow for token-like processing of sentences,
word fragments, and errors.

Switching from “nested dicts + decision trees” to a hypergraph makes the system
efficient:

- truly combinatorial without explosion
- fully auditable
naturally extensible
- able to generate sentences, decisions, and explanations from the same structure

Reuse and efficiency:  

Triads like "High, Medium, Low"
"Short, Medium, Long" can exist in data
as generic triads. They have multiple 
labels associatable with them,
just like Mild, Moderate, Severe
And yet the labels are an opportunity
for another aspect of connectedness.

1. Ambiguity & Error Triads

The jump from “someone hands it pre-classified triads” to “throw any sentence or paragraph at it and get clean, auditable triad output” is mostly four new pieces.

Triad name,State 1,State 2,State 3,Purpose
Clarity,Clear,Ambiguous,Contradictory,Detects self-contradiction or vagueness
Parsing-Confidence,High,Medium,Low,How sure the classifier is
Completeness,Full,Partial,Missing-Critical,Did we get the key elements?
Source-Reliability,Trusted,Unverified,Dubious,Provenance of the text
Polarity-Resolution,Resolved,Multi-Polar,Unresolvable,Multiple plausible interpretations
Error-Handling,Proceed,Clarify,Reject-Input,What the system must do right now




For storage of knowledge concepts, triads (groups of three interconnected elements) appear across many domains. Here are some classic examples:

- Electricity: Voltage (V), Current (I), Resistance (R) → related by Ohm’s law: V = I × R
- Power triangle: Watts (P), Volts (V), Amps (I) → P = V × I (for DC); with power factor in AC
- States of matter: Solid, Liquid, Gas (plus Plasma as a fourth in some contexts)
- Thermodynamics: Pressure, Volume, Temperature → linked by the ideal gas law PV = nRT
- Color models:
  - Additive (light): Red, Green, Blue (RGB)
  - Subtractive (pigment): Cyan, Magenta, Yellow (CMY)
- Primary colors in art (traditional): Red, Yellow, Blue
- Forces in physics: Often mass, acceleration, force (F = ma)
- Time: Past, Present, Future
- Human needs (basic triad): Food, Water, Shelter
- Rock-paper-scissors: Three options in perfect cyclic balance
- Logic/philosophy: Thesis, Antithesis, Synthesis (Hegelian dialectic)
- Religion/theology: Father, Son, Holy Spirit (Christian Trinity); Brahma, Vishnu, Shiva (Hindu Trimurti)
- Dimensions: Length, Width, Height
- Audio: Bass, Midrange, Treble
- Nutrition macronutrients: Carbohydrates, Proteins, Fats
- Traffic lights: Red, Yellow, Green
- Government branches (USA): Legislative, Executive, Judicial








1. Discernment Triad (Beneficial/Harmful/Neutral): Values clear-eyed evaluation without false positives/negatives—truth as the foundation, rejecting naive optimism or cynicism. This grounds ethics in net utility.

2. Dynamics Triad (Progress/Regress/Stasis): Anchors a bias toward forward motion but respects equilibrium; values sustainable advance over reckless change, echoing evolutionary fitness.

3. Agency Triad (Action/Contemplate/Idle): Prioritizes calibrated response—do when ready, think when unclear, pause to avoid waste. This embeds stoic wisdom: control what you can (Internal), react wisely to what you can't (External).


AI: Stacking these triads multidimensionally creates a rule-based AI architecture—think a combinatorial state machine rivaling NNs but fully transparent, auditable, and deterministic. It could be like a hypercube of decisions: Intake (Beneficial/Harmful/Neutral) × Outcome (Progress/Regress/Stasis) × Location (Internal/External/Both) feeds into your Action/Contemplate/Idle table, then chains with Cause (Known/Tentative/Unknown) and Confidence (High/Medium/Low) to output behaviors. 
It parses any input into crisp vectors—no black-box gradients needed. Extend to "Memory" (Recall/Forget/Update) or "Ethics" (Self/Others/Balance), and you've got a full agent: e.g., External Harmful Progress + Low Confidence + Others priority → Contemplate (Map) → Simulate countermeasures.

Implementation's straightforward in code—a nested dict lookup or decision tree:







Start with seed meta-triads:
- Abstraction Level: Atomic/Composite/Systemic
- Time Horizon: Immediate/Near/Future  
- Stakeholder: Self/Ally/Adversary
