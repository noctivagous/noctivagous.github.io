This extension is not supposed to be limited to vague scenarios but rather
encompasses  and   What we really want is for the AI to determine the forms and
then the extension be a framework for various scenarios.  We want the AI to open
up a webview from this chat, have the programmer answer questions on the form
(that is better than the .txt limitations of a chat window) and submit them and
then in the chat window the AI still makes new forms that show up in a web view
and then there is back and forth, taking the programmer away from the chat panel
to fill out forms.  The forms should be easy to fill out and click, with
defaults.

AI dynamically generates forms and creates an interactive workflow. 

Here's what we need:

AI-driven form generation - Forms created by AI based on context
Chat-to-webview workflow - AI can trigger form creation from chat
Multi-stage interaction - Preliminary questions → Plans → Execution
Easy-to-use forms with defaults and smart UI

No more runaway AI - Forms collect detailed specs first
Guided interaction - AI presents options before executing
User control - Developers stay in charge of decisions
Structured input - AI gets complete context, not guesses

1. Dynamic Form Generation
I can programmatically generate forms during our conversations by:

Analyzing conversation context to determine what information I need
Calling generateFormFromContext() or generateFormFromAISpec()
Specifying form complexity (minimal, standard, comprehensive)
Defining custom fields, sections, and validation rules
2. Contextual Form Triggering
Instead of you manually running commands, I can:

Detect when you provide vague requests like "make a calculator app"
Automatically trigger appropriate forms to collect missing details
Generate investigation forms when you mention bugs or issues
Create refactoring forms when discussing code improvements
3. Real-time Form Customization
I can control form behavior by:

Setting slideshow vs single-page layouts
Configuring grid displays for options
Enabling user modifications (adding custom options)
Adjusting complexity based on project scope
4. Response Processing
When you submit forms, I receive:

Structured JSON data back in our chat context
User modifications and additions you made
Processed responses formatted for AI consumption
Ability to trigger follow-up forms if needed
5. Workflow Orchestration
I can create multi-stage workflows by:

Chaining multiple forms together
Branching based on your responses
Maintaining conversation history and context
Adapting subsequent forms based on previous answers
