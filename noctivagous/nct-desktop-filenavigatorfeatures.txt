Features for File Navigators

FILETYPE MODES: FILTERING + VIEWER

1. FILETYPE MODES: FILTERING + VIEWER

In the File Navigator, there is an option
called images-only and it filters all
files displayed to just images and presents
them in a photo viewer presentation that has its own
views such as carousel, grid, and list.   This would allow
browsing a directory that contains images
while excluding other file types from the
listing. It allows browsing them without
having to open up a separate app.

The same could be applied to other file types
such as video and text.  And importantly, it
could be recursively applied to a directory
(taking in its subdirectories), so that a directory
with organized images in its subtree would
have all of the images listed and organized.

When videos are listed, they can be shown
with thumbnails that are made of a
grid of frames.


2. FILE AND DIRECTORY TAGGING

A related feature to this is tagging, including
recognition by the system that once the user
tags a file of a certain name that it will move
the file to a predetermined directory location
(e.g. "Video Project 1").  Tags also would
allow searching the file system in a different
way and setting up pseudo-directories that
compile a listing of all files and directories
of a certain tag or tags.

3. EVENTS

When a directory's contents changes and it is
registered as an observed directory, an action
is triggered, such as a script (or system action).
