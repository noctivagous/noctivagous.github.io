THE AI IDENTIFIES AND GENERATES PARAMETERS FOR THE SITUATION:
PRELIMINARY AND INTERMEDIATE MENUS ALLOW THE AI TO
GUIDE THE USER TO USE AI FOR THE GIVEN TASK BEFORE THE AI
UNDERTAKES WORK

--> In Many Cases, After The User Submits The Initial Prompt,
The AI Should Generate Parameters for The Situation
For The User to Fill Out or Configure Before It Generates Output.

Though it depends on the situation, quite often too much labor is required of
the user to put together a complete and detailed text prompt to get a
satisfactory result from AI.  The usual sequence involves the user reacting
to what the AI generated repeatedly because the user didn't provide comprehensive
details to prevent.  This is a key reason that usage of AI falls short of
expectations.  The AI should be involved in collecting those details. 

Take for example the generation of an image.  I said to the AI, "Make a playing
card with the image of a joker on it."  I found out, after getting the result,
that what the AI had in its assumptions was far from what I was expecting (or perhaps
what other people would exist too). It made an image of a joker featuring an actor 
from a recent movie in a photorealistic style inside a playing card frame.  
It turns out that I was going to have to tell it a significant
number of specifying details upfront: 
	- what illustration style (photorealistic). 
	- what the joker should look like. 
	- what the joker should be doing. 
	- The position of the joker.
	- The clothing.
	- etc.

For routine usage of AI, all of these parameters take too much work to come up
with on the spot.  It's way too much to expect from the user at the first step and it 
is also work that the AI should be generate for an intermediate step before generation
of the image occures.

In short, the situation should really be the AI coming up with these kinds of
parameters first and asking them in a preliminary menu that features GUI
controls.

Example:

--- AI: You said you want a joker on a playing card. 

	- What illustration style? [dropdown menu] 
	- What kind of joker? [dropdown menu] Other: [Textfield]
	- What position should the joker be in? [dropdown menu] Other: [Textfield]. 
	- What clothing? [dropdown menu]
	More specifying information: [Textfield].

This is a set of the details that the user might not fully anticipate and will 
only find out are relevant after the image has been generated.  Then the user 
will have to laboriously revise with new images being generated.

If this is image is being generated in a node flow diagram environment then it
would be the AI asking questions before generating the nodes.

It should be that the AI is taking care of the intermediate work of providing
the menu of parameters, the parameters that currently aren't specified by the
user until after finding out how the AI made the image and departed from
expectations.

A software application is useful proportionate to the amount of control the user
has over the output, with an application like Excel demonstrating high levels of
user control.  The usability of those controls and a smooth arrangement of 
them is what makes quality software.  When, however, software produces flashy, 
advanced output but the user's ability to control the output is limited, e.g.
AI-generated images produced just from text prompts, then this is largely
a novelty or an uncomfortable and unfinished situation.  The effort required
to turn the output into something of value is too high.  AI generation of images
can be put into other software contexts where user control is higher, such as node 
flow diagram scripting environments.  

During an onstage interview, an OpenAI executive called ChatGPT "the world's greatest 
parlor trick."  People everywhere have managed since the time he said that to make 
ChatGPT work for them in spite of the undeveloped state of the front-end.  It is 
still the case that ChatGPT produces a novelty effect because the front-end software 
is incomplete. The amount of control the user can have over the output is much less 
than it should be (e.g. there is no control over output length, it is hard to steer 
responses, etc.).  Addressing this gap requires more than just the addition of gui
controls.  The AI should generate parameters for any situation.  Intermediate menus are 
important for AI chatbot software like ChatGPT to assist the user in making use
of the AI.
