Preliminary Menus for AI Chatbots

I said to the AI, "Make a playing card with the image of a joker on it."  
I found out, after getting the result, that what the AI put together from its 
assumptions was distant from my expectations.  It made an image of a an actor 
from a recent joker movie in a photorealistic style inside a life-sized playing 
card frame.  It turns out that I was going to have to tell the AI a significant 
number of specifying details upfront to get what I wanted: 


- What illustration style (etched illustration, not photorealistic). 
- What the joker should look like (comic book/real life). 
- What the joker should be doing. 
- The position of the joker on the card.
- The clothing.
- etc.

That's too much to ask of me for every AI prompt when I am using AI.  For routine 
usage of AI, such a wide-ranging list of situational parameters requires too much 
work to come up with inside the text box, yet it is what is needed for AI image 
generation.  The AI can provide this information, though, once it recognizes that 
the prompt needs it.  It can serve the details formatted as a preliminary, 
interactive menu as the first response.

Example Exchange:
----------------------------------------
--- User: Make a playing card with the image of a joker on it.

--- AI: 
Image to generate: A joker on a playing card.

- What illustration style? [dropdown menu] 
- What kind of joker? [dropdown menu] Other: [Textfield]
- What position should the joker be in? [dropdown menu] Other: [Textfield]. 
- Looking in what direction?  [dropdown menu]
- What clothing style? [dropdown menu]
- This is a playing card that is on a table or life-sized?
More specifying information: [Textfield].

----------------------------------------

This is a range of details that the user might not fully anticipate and will have a 
hard time listing off during regular usage of AI.  This preliminary menu doesn't 
have to be limited to the generation of images, of course, and can be applied to 
any situation such as text and code.




----------------------------------------
----------------------------------------

AFTER RECEIVING THE INITIAL PROMPT FROM THE USER,
THE AI GENERATES A MENU OF IMPORTANT AND RELEVANT
DETAILS FOR THE SITUATION.

THE USER TO FILLS THESE OUT AND SUBMITS THE 
FORM TO GET BETTER RESULTS FROM AI FROM THE START.

STEPS:
--> THE USER SENDS A PROMPT FOR THE AI TO CARRY OUT A TASK
(E.G. GENERATE AN IMAGE).

--> A PRELIMINARY MENU IS GENERATED BY AI BEFORE FULFILLING THE REQUEST 
THAT ALLOWS IT TO COLLECT INFORMATION ABOUT THE SITUATION FROM
THE USER BEFORE UNDERTAKING WORK.  THE AI DOESN'T JUST
IMMEDIATELY ATTEMPT TO DO THE THING ASKED LIKE TODAY.

--> IF IT IS AN IMAGE BEING GENERATED, THE AI COMES UP WITH
ALL OF THE DETAILS OF THE IMAGE'S SCENE THAT THE USER WOULD WANT TO
SPECIFY AND THEN FORMATS THAT INFORMATION INSIDE A PRELIMINARY 
FORM TO BE FILLED OUT.

-------> AFTER THE USER MAKES SELECTIONS FROM THE PRELIMINARY FORM AND
SUBMITS IT, THE AI GENERATES THE IMAGE. THROUGH THIS, THE AI GENERATES 
MORE SATISFACTORY, TAILORED OUTPUT FROM THE START.


SUMMARY:
--> In Many Cases, After The User Submits The Initial Prompt,
The AI Should Generate Details for The Situation
For The User to Fill Out or Configure Before It Generates Output. 


---


Often it is the case that too much labor is required of the user to put together 
a complete and detailed text prompt to get a satisfactory result from AI on
the first submission.  The usual sequence involves the user repeatedly reacting to what the 
AI generated in order to correct and revise it, which is a labor-intensive 
and tiresome process.  This happens because the user hardly ever
provides comprehensive details from the start and lets the AI operate off of
its assumptions and guesses about what the user wants.  But there is no way to accurately
know what the AI will assume every time.  This is a key reason that usage of AI in
AI chatbots falls short of expectations.  The AI should be involved in proactively 
suggesting and collecting specifications for the situation in preliminary menus. 
The user may not anticipate everything that a situation entails.

Take for example the generation of an image.  

I said to the AI, "Make a playing card with the image of a joker on it."  
I found out, after getting the result, that what the AI had sitting in its 
assumptions was far from what I was expecting (and perhaps far from what other 
people would expect too). It made an image of a joker featuring an actor from a 
recent movie in a photorealistic style inside a life-sized playing card frame.  
It turns out that I was going to have to tell the AI a significant number of 
specifying details upfront to get what I wanted: 
	- what illustration style (etching, not photorealistic). 
	- what the joker should look like (comic book/real life). 
	- what the joker should be doing. 
	- The position of the joker on the card.
	- The clothing.
	- etc.

That's too much to ask of me for every AI prompt. For routine usage of AI, such a 
wide-ranging list of situational parameters takes too much work to 
come up with inside a text box.  It is work that the AI should generate once it 
sees that the prompt needs it.  It can provide format this in a preliminary menu 
as the first response instead of generating the image first.


To summarize, the chat exchange should really be the AI coming up with these kinds of
situational parameters first and then asking them in a preliminary menu (that features GUI
form controls like dropdown menus, checkboxes, etc.).

Example:

--- User: Make a playing card with the image of a joker on it.

--- AI: You said you want a joker on a playing card.

	- What illustration style? [dropdown menu] 
	- What kind of joker? [dropdown menu] Other: [Textfield]
	- What position should the joker be in? [dropdown menu] Other: [Textfield]. 
	- Looking in what direction?  [dropdown menu]
	- What clothing style? [dropdown menu]
	- This is a playing card that is on a table or life-sized?
	More specifying information: [Textfield].

This is a set of details that the user might not fully anticipate, will have
a hard time listing off just for routine usage of AI.  The user will 
only find out many of them are relevant after the image has been generated.  
Then the user will have to respond with revising instructions to generate 
new images.

If this is image is being generated in a node flow diagram scripting environment, 
then it would be the AI generating and displaying a preliminary menu that generates 
the nodes and their default parameters.

It should be that the AI is taking care of the intermediate work of providing
a menu of parameters for the context.

A software application is useful proportionate to the amount of control the user
has over the output, with an application like Excel demonstrating high levels of
user control (data entry cells, charts generated).  The usability of those 
controls and a smooth arrangement of them is what makes quality software.  
When, however, software produces flashy, advanced output but the user's ability to 
control the output is limited, e.g. AI-generated images produced just from text prompts, 
then this is largely a novelty or an uncomfortable and unfinished situation.  
The effort required to turn the output into something of value is too high.  
AI generation of images can be put into other software contexts where user control is 
higher, such as node flow diagram scripting environments.  

During an onstage interview, an OpenAI executive called ChatGPT "the world's greatest 
parlor trick."  People everywhere have managed since the time he said that to make 
ChatGPT work for them in spite of the undeveloped state of the front-end.  It is 
still the case that ChatGPT produces a novelty effect because the front-end software 
is incomplete. The amount of control the user can have over the output is much less 
than it should be (e.g. there is no control over output length, it is hard to steer 
responses, etc.).  Addressing this gap requires more than just the addition of gui
controls.  The AI should generate parameters for any situation.  Intermediate menus are 
important for AI chatbot software like ChatGPT to assist the user in making use
of the AI.
