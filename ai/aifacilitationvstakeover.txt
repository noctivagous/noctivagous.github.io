AI Facilitation of Work Processes vs. AI Takeover of Human Jobs

A vegetable-cutting appliance for the kitchen 
that will cut or dice any vegetable placed inside 
its box would be of great use to the home cook.  
This type of device would have been challenging 
to construct before recent advances in AI, as the 
device has to be able to recognize every type of 
vegetable placed inside it and, on its 
own, know how to peel or cut accurately. 
It has to know that something inside is a vegetable
and not something else. This is now achievable in a 
straightforward way by training a neural network.
Whether it is the cutting or the recognition of
the vegetables, a neural network would be trained,
just like the current GPTs.

We use this example device to explain how technologists
should view AI, as a means to solve individual problems
as they currently exist rather than replace human activities.
The dimensions of this appliance would be about that
of a large microwave, with a price that is 
affordable for the consumer. It would be utilized 
by anyone for enabling convenient, at-home cooking. 
Unlike many attempts to place AI in the kitchen,
the purpose of this appliance is deliberately limited 
to cutting and peeling of vegetables. This appears at 
first arbitrary to those who are unfamiliar with 
home cooking.  But others, who cook regularly and 
also have other responsibilities, know that cutting vegetables 
is always an involved process, even if the person has no 
objections to doing it as a chore.  A food processor appliance 
serves primarily to enable quantity; it also requires that vegetables 
are cut into pieces in advance, so it only partly addresses
the issue of cutting vegetables.  Additionally, it has
multiple parts that need to be cleaned afterwards, adding to the
existing need to wash the knives and the cutting board.

When the vegetables are taken out of this AI-driven kitchen device
they will be completely ready for cooking or assembling for
cold dishes, such as salsa.  The machine also cuts up the scraps
and places them to the side of the cut vegetables for easy composting
or other uses, and because of this the device does not need to dispose 
of anything through a plumbing attachment and it is self-contained.
It would just have a cleaning mode after being provided soap and water, 
also driven by AI.

The point is that the device does not attempt to take over the entire
process of cooking but instead directly addresses an issue that
cooks encounter: vegetable cutting is the main impediment to regular 
cooking at home, because even if people enjoy doing it
or they don't mind the chore, it creates a hassle that cannot
be easily overcome at all times.  The extra work it creates
for cleanup often takes too much time and even taking out
the bowls to hold the prepared vegetables adds some hidden complexity
to the cooking.

Contrast this device and its goals with the conventional mentality 
and approach for making a kitchen appliance that incorporates AI: 
it will be an expensive robot that has moving arms (outside of
a box) and it will be able to cook what it cuts too, moving around
the stove and kitchen on a track perhaps. Apart from requiring 
far more engineering and AI technology than can be affordable 
for the average consumer today, this robot setup is unlikely 
to be manufactured for the consumer within a reasonable timeframe, 
and it will be a concept product for a long time, limited to restaurants, 
who might not even want such a robot given the expense.  
The size of the device will be large, the assembly will likely 
require a professional's supervision, safety will be an issue with 
its large swinging parts and arms if anyone is present, and it 
will not necessarily fit in an average household kitchen.  
It won't be considered worth it by most homeowners, just to have 
an extra cook, because of all the downsides.  Thus the second
approach, this takeover of the whole process by making
a partial humanoid that roams across the kitchen, is an inferior 
way to utilize AI in a kitchen appliance for our current times,
if we want AI to be of use to us in the near future for real life.  
A chef robot also stirs a person inside, as the entire cooking activity 
has been taken over completely-- supposedly for the purpose of 
making everyday life easier.  Though it makes life easier in that way,
it doesn't have to do that, as we just demonstrated, because
only one part of the cooking process is currently causing significant
obstacles for people.  The chef robot doesn't solve anything for
regular people whereas the vegetable-cutting appliance does.

Therefore, the goal of an AI device should not be to make life easy to the 
point that no human effort has to be expended in order to 
make something complex occur but instead fix or facilitate existing 
processes that carry complicated aspects, especially those that 
are causing problems because they are missing pieces in their puzzle.
For home cooking, it's the vegetable cutting stage that needs to be
made a cinch and then everything else will be much easier.  To give another example, 
there are probably only a few aspects of making a road that need to be 
addressed by an AI machine, and in the same way this would immediately 
make road construction faster and more affordable, just like the vegetable-cutting
appliance.  In the case of road construction, it can be the
laying down of road material that can be done by the AI because
of the precision and consistency it can provide at this stage,
reducing the fatigue impacting workers for the other stages.

The AI community would start its road construction product 
by trying to do everything from start to finish, with a very large machine,
and it would remove all workers from the situation as a goal.  
Instead, it is almost certain that the workers could be kept
but provided one or more AI-driven machines that take care of the hassles
that are causing holdups or unnecessary wear on the workers.  
This is the discussion of AI's complete takeover of an entire job versus 
AI's facilitation of certain stages of the work process.  
AI takeover is undesirable and is the prevalent mindset at AI companies, 
whereas AI facilitation is basically an absent topic of discussion.

At least in the short-term, it would be beneficial to
have a device that assists road construction for some problems
that make it take too much time but not try to take every 
aspect over from the workers, start to finish, because when a certain
shortcoming of the process has been addressed, the solution provided 
by the AI will appear immediately and the solution will be much more 
powerful, more feasible to actually implement and put on the market, 
and it wonâ€™t replace humans, who should be directing technology.

In the case  of the vegetable-cutting  device that can sit next to 
the microwave, the barrier to AI providing something
helpful is extremely low compared to what is extremely high: 
a big, expensive robot requiring complicated assembly screwed 
into the wall or placed on a track that roams across the kitchen.  
The purpose of AI has not been confined with the vegetable-cutting
device but rather directed into a more rational objective, to deal 
with what has been identified as inadequate for people's process.  
This is an AI philosophy that does not aim to push people out of the
whole activity and do it all for them, such as to write the entire paper, to
make the entire illustration for them, to cook the entire meal
from a predefined setting, to make the entire road, and thus the 
outcome will be higher quality and controllable.
This involves going through the effort to identify what is missing first.  
What is the obstacle in a given activity, such as how home cooking is 
psychologically and practically impeded by the
friction of having to peel and cut vegetables and 
then clean up the scraps afterwards.  By comparison,
the current intentions of AI research are lazy,
as they aren't willing examine what is wrong
in any given situation, just make a one-size-fits all megamachine that takes
over everything that people do.  What follows is a job
that is too much for AI engineering, which is a machine that has to do
everything for something.

Of course in theory a multipurpose personal robot would take care of
everything from house cleaning to cooking, 
but in practice that will be expensive for a long time
and will not appear as a finished consumer product
for many years to come given the current state of
technology.  So the first goal is
to recognize that there is this kind of excessive optimism in
the tech industry which can never deliver such products
on time and admit that for AI to truly serve people it 
has to be applied to existing situations such that it lubricates
the gears of life, not usurps entire jobs of everyday life.  
If something helpful makes people uncomfortable, it is 
following the wrong track.

There is also a lack of clarity of purpose for
something like ChatGPT, because on the surface
it would exist to write papers for people from
start to finish so that they don't have to
do anything, or write entire computer programs
for them from start to finish that compile. 
That is at first glance what its purpose would be.
It will be a long time before that happens and in the
first place it would then be literature that
is AI-flavored no matter how the AI was constructed.
It would then be a new culture of AI-directed 
app programming instead of truly replacing 
regular programming.  Then the AI companies
retreat from this position and say that the GPT
is a tool for all kinds of tasks (as long as you
can figure out what they are and how to get it
to do them), which it certainly can serve as
quite capably, but that wasn't really how the GPT
was setup, so there is a misalignment of stated
product offering and the form that the product
takes.
