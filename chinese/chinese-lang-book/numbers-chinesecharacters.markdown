The method of writing numbers in Chinese is closely related to the principles of **ideographic** character formation, particularly in the **指事 (indicative)** and **会意 (compound ideograph)** categories. Here's how:

### Table: Structure and Origin of Basic Chinese Numerals

| Number | Character | Type            | Description                                                                                                                                |
| ------ | --------- | --------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| 1      | 一         | 指事 (indicative) | A single horizontal stroke—directly indicates the concept of “one.”                                                                        |
| 2      | 二         | 指事 (indicative) | Two horizontal strokes—symbolizes “two.”                                                                                                   |
| 3      | 三         | 指事 (indicative) | Three horizontal strokes—represents “three.”                                                                                               |
| 4      | 四         | 会意 + 形声         | Originally a compound of elements indicating enclosure + pronunciation (similar to 口). 囗 is semantic component, 儿-like shape is phonetic.  |
| 5      | 五         | 会意              | Derived from combining elements related to hand or actions, symbolizing counting or aggregation.                                           |
| *6–9*    | 六–九       | 会意 / 形声         | These have more abstract origins; they include phonetic and ideographic elements based on early oracle bone script or bronze inscriptions. |
| 6      | 六         | 会意 → 形声 | Originally a **compound ideograph**: in oracle bone script, possibly a roof-like shape suggesting division or shelter. Later evolved into a **phonosemantic compound**, with the component 八 (division) possibly hinting at the concept of parts or segmentation.                               |
| 7      | 七          | 指事 / 会意 | Early forms suggest a **cutting tool** or **dividing stroke**, possibly signifying partition. Though simple, it evolved abstractly and may derive from a symbolic notion of severing or separating into parts. Some scholars consider it originally **indicative** or **compound ideographic**. |
| 8      | 八          | 会意      | Clearly a **compound ideograph**: two diagonal strokes diverging—interpreted as **division into two parts**, symbolizing duality or branching. Visually expressive of separation or "splitting."                                                                                                |
| 9      | 九          | 会意 → 形声 | The oracle bone form resembled a bent hand or arm, possibly symbolizing **completeness nearing an end** (i.e., just before ten). It later evolved a **phonosemantic role**, with some phonetic association influencing the final shape.                                                         |

| 10     | 十         | 指事 (indicative) | A cross—possibly symbolizing completeness or two hands (5+5), later formalized as "ten."                                                   |

### Notes:

* The characters for **1 to 3** are direct representations—ideograms in the purest form.
* **10 (十)** also falls into the **指事** category, as its shape evolved from a line with a cross stroke to denote a complete group.
* Higher numerals, like 百 (hundred), 千 (thousand), and 万 (ten thousand), are **会意** or **形声** characters, combining meaning-bearing and phonetic components.

### Relationship to Chinese Character Development:

The development of numerals mirrors the broader system of Chinese script:

* **Early numerals** are **pure ideographs**, directly representing quantity.
* **Larger numbers** become **compound ideographs** or **phono-semantic compounds**, consistent with how complex characters evolved from simple pictorial or ideographic forms.

Thus, Chinese numerals exemplify the transition from **direct representation of meaning** to **abstraction and compounding**, which underlies the entire script system.

Here is a continuation of Chinese numerals beyond ten, showing how they fit into the ideographic and compound systems of character construction:

### Table: Chinese Numerals Beyond 10

| Number      | Character | Type                | Etymology / Structure                                                                                                        |
| ----------- | --------- | ------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 10          | 十         | 指事 (indicative)     | Cross stroke representing completeness or union (possibly two hands).                                                        |
| 20          | 二十        | 合成词 (compound word) | Literally “two tens.” Combines 二 (2) + 十 (10). Not a single character, but a logical compound.                               |
| 100         | 百         | 会意 → 形声             | Originally a pictograph of something wrapped or coiled (suggesting fullness); later became phonosemantic with 白 as phonetic. |
| 1,000       | 千         | 会意 → 形声             | Originally represented a person holding something (suggesting multitude); later included elements for sound and meaning.     |
| 10,000      | 万 (萬)     | 会意 → 形声             | Traditional form (萬) depicts a scorpion or curled insect, symbolizing vastness; 万 is the simplified form.                    |
| 100 million | 亿 (億)     | 形声                  | Traditional 億 combines meanings of person/speech with sound component; simplified 亿 is abbreviated.                          |

### Additional Elements Used in Large Numbers

| Place Value           | Character | Meaning           | Notes                                                             |
| --------------------- | --------- | ----------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 10² (hundred)         | 百         | 100               | Common standalone numeral.                                        |
| 10³ (thousand)        | 千         | 1,000             | Used without classifier.                                          |
| 10⁴ (ten thousand)    | 万         | 10,000            | Key distinction: Chinese groups large numbers by 10⁴, not 10³.    |
| 10⁸ (hundred million) | 亿         | 100,000,000       | Used in modern finance and population statistics.                 |
| 10¹² (trillion)       | 兆         | 1,000,000,000,000 | Historically varied in meaning; in modern usage, represents 10¹². |

### Structural Observations:

* Numbers above 10 often **combine basic numerals** (like 二十 = 2×10), which reflects a **multiplicative compounding strategy**, different from character derivation but consistent with the logic-based structure of Chinese writing.
* Single-character numerals for large magnitudes (百, 千, 万, 亿, 兆) evolved from **pictographic and ideographic roots**, though many have become **phonosemantic compounds** through later script reform.

### Summary:

The method of writing numbers beyond 10 in Chinese is less pictographic in appearance but maintains ideographic and compounding logic. While most high-value numerals are not transparent in their modern simplified form, they still descend from characters shaped by ideographic or phonetic elements, consistent with the broader framework of Chinese character evolution.



Thank you for the clarification. You're absolutely correct—the lines in the *Three Character Classic* that concern numbers are:

> **一而十，十而百。百而千，千而萬。**
> **三才者，天地人。三光者，日月星。**

Here is a detailed analysis of these lines:

### Table: Analysis of the Number Passage in the *Three Character Classic*

| Line    | Characters                                       | Literal Translation                                                            | Interpretation |
| ------- | ------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | -------------- |
| 一而十     | "One and then ten"                               | From one comes ten—signifies multiplication or increase                        |                |
| 十而百     | "Ten and then hundred"                           | Ten leads to a hundred—continuing numerical progression                        |                |
| 百而千     | "Hundred and then thousand"                      | Progression from hundreds to thousands                                         |                |
| 千而萬     | "Thousand and then ten thousand"                 | The highest standard unit in traditional Chinese counting                      |                |
| 三才者，天地人 | "The Three Powers are: Heaven, Earth, and Man"   | Reflects the Confucian cosmological triad—universal structure and hierarchy    |                |
| 三光者，日月星 | "The Three Luminaries are: Sun, Moon, and Stars" | The three sources of celestial light—foundational to timekeeping and cosmology |                |

### Interpretation and Significance

#### 1. **Numerical Philosophy and Education**

* These lines illustrate **numerical scaling by powers of ten**, which mirrors the **decimal structure** of Chinese numerals.
* The formulaic pattern "A 而 B" (A and then B) conveys **logical progression and growth**—one of the core ideas behind early moral and intellectual development in Confucian education.

#### 2. **Integration of Morality and Cosmology**

* The second pair of lines shifts from arithmetic to **metaphysical principles**:

  * **三才 (Three Powers)**: Heaven (天), Earth (地), and Man (人)—foundational in Confucian and Daoist cosmology.
  * **三光 (Three Luminaries)**: Sun (日), Moon (月), and Stars (星)—key to **time, rhythm, and order** in classical thought.

This linkage implies that **learning numbers is not isolated from learning about one’s place in the world**. Numerical understanding is tied to cosmological awareness and moral order.

#### 3. **Educational Function**

* The progression from numerals (quantitative) to cosmology (qualitative) reflects the **Confucian model of layered education**:

  * Begin with the tangible (numbers),
  * Then move to the structured world (Heaven–Earth–Man),
  * Finally understand the divine order (celestial bodies).

### Summary

The passage:

> **一而十，十而百。百而千，千而萬。三才者，天地人。三光者，日月星。**

presents numbers as part of a **natural, moral, and cosmic order**. It teaches the **decimal progression** foundational to Chinese numeration while emphasizing that learning is not only practical but metaphysical. The student is guided from **arithmetical understanding to a comprehension of universal structure**, embodying the educational ideals of traditional Chinese philosophy.
