ADDITIONAL PROPERTIES, BEHAVIORS AND STATES FOR FILES AND DIRECTORIES


On the hard disk, a file directory is just a listing of the files and directories it contains and in the past it was just output on the screen in plain text.  When a file system is presented in a GUI in what is called the File Navigator or File Manager, the presentation and behavior of the filesystem does not have to confine itself to this limited situation that came from text terminal screens.


In a GUI File Navigator, the user could change the generic directory to behave in ways specific to its contents.  A directory might take on a set of states and presentation layers specific to its purpose:


* A photo album.
   * The window defaults to image viewing functions
   * The window carries photo editing functions, including batch operations for image editing. 
* A scrapbook
   * The window provides functions for tagging or classifying images.
* A video clip bin (for video editors)
   * The window provides basic editing functions such as trim to prepare duplicates of clips for editing.
* A bookshelf (for PDFs)
   * The window provides eBook viewers


* A “smart” collection folder
   * The directory receives updates from the file system about files with a given tag or subject classification on the hard drive and compiles them into this mirror listing.
   * Alternatively, the directory moves all files or directories with a given tag or classification to its location as soon as they are given that tag or classification.


* A web bookmarks folder
   * Browser each .weburl (example file extension) file will retrieve the web page.


* An internet feeds folder
   * Contains and allows for layout of feeds from remote sources, including e-mail.


In this way, the File Navigator takes on software functionality that is often the domain of applications, but this provides better conveniences for use of the computer.
 








DESCRIPTION PROPERTY


Files and directories should have descriptions entries included with them that explain what they are in a sentence, which can be displayed in the File Navigator.  This will allow browsing the drive and becoming familiar with what the system’s structure, such as what sbin, bin, usr, etc. all mean and what their contents are about.  Especially for a UNIX system like Linux, there are many files and directories that are not obvious by their name and this could allow viewing their purposes at a glance.


CLASSIFICATION PROPERTY 
Additionally, the File Navigator should feature the option to assign classifications to files.  The filesystem should already come shipped with taxonomy classifications for every system and application file and directory, sometimes more than one per file or directory.  This way, regardless of where the file is located, it can be compiled in a search result with similar files.  This will also allow, for example, greying-out directories and files that are of a certain category.  If the user does not want to go through system files, he can browse the filesystem with that category hidden the whole time.  In the inverse scenario, this would allow browsing the file system with just one or a few classifications (labels/tags) turned on, perhaps only browsing the system files for example.  




RELATED FILES


This also allows for an entry which is “related files” which will allow files to be associated with each other.  This can carry an option where related files and directories inside a directory can be “glued” which means that when they are moved they have to move together.


The “related files” entry and a unique identifier or marker for a group of files that are related to each other will allow for tracking and uninstallation of all files and directories installed by a package.  They all carry the same unique marker, which is initially placed on them by the installer.




APPEARANCE PROPERTIES


Another property that can be added is one that changes the appearance of the directory or file on the filesystem, whether it is the highlight color of the directory or file or its font size relative to other files.


By adding properties, files and directories can have multiple names.


An important point is that organizing and navigating files on the file system by the two primary options of name or data type is not sufficient because 
1. A filename
2. A .PDF could be a book, a resume, or an invoice.


If all files that are resumes on the drive are given the tag label “Work > Resume” then they can be navigated this way instead.  If files are all given classification paths like  “Work > Resume”, “Media Projects > Video > Trailer” or “Media Projects > Websites > Online Store“ then the user can avoid browsing the computer’s disk by directory tree and instead by these paths that relate to use of the computer.  


Related to this, the File Navigator can have two separate navigation window types: the first is the conventional file browsing while the other navigates files and applications that have been organized according to this separate scheme, which might at first be for navigating personal and professional files and documents and not as much software development work, though this could change later.




For organizing the filesystem, a user might first tag all files that are part of a project or category of scrapbooking with a specific tag.  Then the user can make a so-called “smart” directory that either 1) moves all of the files with that tag inside it or 2) shows a maintained mirror list of these files.


GROUPING AND SUBGROUPING (COLLECTIONS) OF FILES AND DIRECTORIES


We have also said that there should be grouping and subgroup operations available for the contents of any directory so that related files can be placed in collections and arranged next to each other.  In a tree representation, grouping and subgrouping can be indicated by outlines and sub-outlines for the groups and subgroups of files and directories located at the same tree level.  will also allow a directory to have a custom presentation, such as tabviews for the different groups and subgroups of files.  It will allow making use of other GUI controls like accordion controls for different sections of a directory.  A directory’s presentation might be customizable.


GUI CONTROLS FOR THE FILE NAVIGATOR


A File Navigator system can list files in a directory by separating them into tabs (A-K, K-P, etc.).
