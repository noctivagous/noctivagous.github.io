      Future Code: The Integration of Graphic Design inside Software Development Editors
      <!-- The Integration of Graphic Design into Software Development Environments-->

</h1>

<h3>Programming Is Stuck inside Terminal Type for Its Typographic Medium, with No 
  Deliberate Graphic Design Present Anywhere
</h3>

    Code looks the way it does because it was engineered for terminal display
    monitors connected to mainframe computers.  The terminals themselves had no 
    processing power.  It is actually this setup that set in stone
    how computer code would be regarded, all the way until today.
     Most of the major programming languages were introduced during the 1970s and 
     early 1980s, a time when computer graphics hardware capabilities 
     were generally limited to text. For the computer monitors of those times, 
     each character had to carry the same width; the monitor was laid out as an invisible grid.
     This is the basic reason behind monospaced type for code.

     <p>
      Afterwards, in the decades that followed, software 
      programmers found it difficult to move past monospaced type 
      as the medium for mainstream computer code.
      There have been attempts to transcend it, especially in the 1990s,
      but none have succeeded, with the result being that people have
      given up and concluded that plain text is the only medium code can have.
      That is very far away from the truth of the situation, if the goal
      is changed to upgrade code from within its existing conditions
      rather than impose something from the outside from the outset.
      In many computer programming circles, there is strong resistance to upgrading any aspect,
      in part because of the many previous attempts and how they fell short,
      implying that it just can't be done.

      <p>
      Yet, at the same time, in the last decade there has been much more 
      interest in adding enhancements for monospaced code, in all modern
      IDEs (code editors).  There are, increasingly, insertions of GUI conveniences
      that work alongside the plain text code, to make the overall software
      engineering situation more consistent with the complexity of modern software.
      
      <p>
      Everything is taking place to make programming better except
      upgrading the plain text itself, to something beyond what it is.  Plain text is
      the main bottleneck to progress for code, and moving past it 
      will produce a programming dynamic more in keeping
      with the display and computing technologies of today, when
      storage, RAM, and processing power are much greater, in exponential
      proportions.
    
      <h3>No Graphic Designers Are Involved in Designing Programming Languages,
        Which Is a Missed Opportunity
      </h3>
    <p>
    This throwback appearance persists due to
    the absence of graphic design specialists 
    who would be working alongside the computer scientists and 
    software engineers shaping software development 
    tools at various commercial enterprises, like Apple, Microsoft, or Google. 
    The two disciplines of graphic design and computer 
    science are too far away from each other, 
    with very few individuals carrying interests 
    or skills in both, and 
    there are few who would become involved 
    in this particular topic in a direct way.  
    Unfortunately, collaboration between graphic designers 
    and computer scientists will be rare until there 
    are deliberate efforts to bridge their communities on this matter.
    <p>
    There are growing signs that this is an unrecognized 
    possibility that would be very attractive to
    the current environment, viewed in light of recent developments.  
    
    <h3>They Are Adding Graphic Design to Code, Just Not Realizing It</h3>

    During the last decade, the code editor’s features for 
    interacting with computer code have been moving steadily 
    in the direction of graphic design and interactive, 
    GUI-based improvements.  It's just that this has occurred
    passively, subconsiously, and isn't discussed in these terms.  
    Most notable lately are 
    "code completion" boxes, first becoming mainstream 
    in the 2010s and now an essential feature for mainstream app development. 
     As the programmer types 
    code in plain text, a GUI-based code completion box 
    is superimposed in the editor, driven by a background computer program, 
    pulling up analyzed suggestions for the variables or objects 
    that the programmer might want to enter.
    All that needs to happen is the press of the Tab key 
    to select the first suggestion
    and the plain text will be inserted. 
    <!-- Arrow keys navigate up and down alternative suggestions in the GUI
    code competion menu.-->  Initially this tool was experienced as a luxury
    but today it is indispensable for making apps quickly and effectively.
    <p>    
    This demonstrates that the mainstream software development 
    community is seeking much more from code’s interactive dynamic 
    than unprocessed plain text.  Though programmers may believe strongly
    in plain text as their best choice for code, they are, in practice, moving away
    from it by adding so many enhancements. Any nostalgia for the command line
    has to face up to this reality, that the computer user 
    couldn't copy and paste lines of text into the old computer terminals, as people
    do with the GUI terminal windows today.  There is, thus, a blending of GUI and plain text
    taking place that has to be transcended.  Put in different terms, it is
    unrecognized jerry-rigging of GUI enhancements in plain text (.TXT).
    
    <p>
     In the view of the mainstream programmers and the computer companies themselves, there is officially no change
    happening to code anywhere, just tweaks to make it better.
    But these tweaks are too substantial for that claim to hold up: 
    in any code editor of the 2020s, there is usually a “code-folding” 
    GUI feature built into left margin of the text view, sitting next to the code line numbers. 
    After these come to be utilized regularly by the larger software
    development community, they have in fact altered
    the dynamic that code has, beyond its plain text origins.
      Many of these features are exposing the inadequacy of how code exists
    when it consists of plain text.  (Noctivagous states that the goal should be
    to start over with a document file format and make that the basis of code,
    but in combination with new user interface principles that rely on keypresses
    instead of tedious mouse coordination and clicks.)

<p>
      These GUI code-folding arrows that are placed in the left margin 
     that allow collapsing or expanding sections of a plain text (.txt) 
     code file are sort of upgrade without formally acknowledging
     an upgrade.  Plain text has a UI but it is too basic, so efforts
     are frequently made to compensate for its deficiencies when it is
     forced to make software that is so large.  
     At the same time, the UI provided by plain text 
     is indeed more effective.  It cannot be escaped through superficial efforts.
     A person truly has to be involved in the UI at a deeper level
     to transcend plain text.

     <p>
      So the first goal for the programming community is to acknowledge
      what is true: if it is now mainstream to depend on a blend of GUI gadgets and plain
      text in order to make code, then mainstream programming relies on shims.
     As more veneer is placed onto plain text like this, 
     what gets lost is that programmers  are actually
     communicating all the time that they want to 
     interact with a formally-established document file format, because that is
     in effect what they are provided already by the modern IDE. 
     Of course they don't realize they are saying that or that their
     actions suggest this.
     All of these added GUI controls and widgets relate exactly to  
     that outcome if the situation is seen for what it is, because it
     is an interactive media document file format that supports these
     modern software features, not terminal type (.TXT). 
     
     <p>
     No software engineer would start a project from scratch by designing
     GUI components that interact with plain text.
     In other words, code editors are moving towards, without 
     actually taking the step of doing it, the upgrade of computer 
     code’s form, away from the old terminal type.  But because
     they don't do it on purpose, the outcome is getting more forced
     and strange.
     This isn't saying that it is inevitable that code will
     move towards a document file format, but that this should
     be the goal.
     
        <p>
    If there is any remaining dispute about this, <!-- in the 2020s, 
    a large, vertical thumbnail image— called a "minimap"— 
    is now generated by the code editor in the right margin 
    of the file of code, for surveying the code file
     in a macro view and navigating it as a minified scroll.  
     In this case, it is the code editor making use of digital 
     image processing, taking a <i>screen capture</i> of the plain text file 
     (.txt) the programmer is working with, and then generating an 
     interactive control for viewing it.  How can anyone hold
     any nostalgia for working with old plain text when everything
     like this is happening, trying to manage it in a different way?

        <p>
    In other areas, code is moving towards a more interactive state as well.
     mainstream AI programmers, which includes the founders of OpenAI, 
    make regular use of Jupyter Notebook, which provides an 
     interactive Python "notebook" for more flexible, 
     prototyping-style programming.  In these notebooks, 
     which are actually documents that allow Python code to be executed
     inside them to produce a different dynamic, 
     images are generated by the programming environment interactively.  
     There is a back and forth possible, 
     in response to the code entered.  
     This is in contrast to a compiled program in which there is no
     interactive output.  

     <!--
     In the first place this shows that typing out code in plain text and then clicking a
      “build and run” button isn’t the only way to make software, 
      because with the computers of today there can be a stage that exists 
      ahead of time, which is to see the results and then modify them.  -->
      When a line of code is entered and there is a chart of information
      produced as a result, code has changed.
      These are the kinds of features that
      interactive media and graphic designers should be involved in.
        
      
      <p>
    If a large community of the graphic designers were 
    introduced to code, as something for them to examine 
    for improvement, the topics that would come up first 
    would likely be: the absence of any page layout, the 
    lack of any meaningful organization in the code. 
     There are no headings, no outlined boxes, no columns of text. 
      There are no side columns for making notes.  And of course, 
      it isn’t even possible to embed an image inside the typical 
      programming language code file.
        <p>
    The undifferentiated appearance of a file of code, 
    and the large amount of screen space waste produced by 
    having only one column (newspaper page layout) of functions 
    at any time, would be obvious missed opportunities to a
     graphic designer.  But if something does not change, 
     that graphic designer or interactive media specialist 
     will not be invited by computer science professionals 
     to a code conference to intervene in the matter.  Instead, 
     code will get incremental add-ons that modify the 
     current situation passively, placing graphical user interfaces 
     on top of plain text.
