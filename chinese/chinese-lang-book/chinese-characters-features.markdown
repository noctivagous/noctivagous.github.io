The **六书 (liù shū)**—literally "Six Writings" or "Six Principles of Character Formation"—is a traditional Chinese system for classifying **how Chinese characters are constructed and used**. It was first formally recorded in the *Shuowen Jiezi* (《说文解字》) by Xu Shen during the Han dynasty.

These six categories reflect both the **structural composition** and **semantic function** of characters. They are foundational to understanding how Chinese script evolved from pictographs into a logographic writing system.

### Table: The Six Principles of Chinese Character Formation (六书)

| No. | Category (Chinese) | Translation                         | Description                                                                                            | Example                                                                         |
| --- | ------------------ | ----------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1   | 象形 (xiàng xíng)    | **Pictographs**                     | Characters that are stylized drawings of physical objects                                              | 日 (sun), 木 (tree), 山 (mountain)                                                 |
| 2   | 指事 (zhǐ shì)       | **Indicatives / Simple Ideographs** | Characters that indicate abstract concepts using symbolic marks                                        | 一 (one), 上 (above), 下 (below)                                                   |
| 3   | 会意 (huì yì)        | **Compound Ideographs**             | Characters formed by combining two or more components to suggest a meaning                             | 明 (bright = sun + moon), 休 (rest = person + tree)                               |
| 4   | 形声 (xíng shēng)    | **Phono-semantic Compounds**        | One part gives meaning (semantic), the other gives sound (phonetic); most common type in modern script | 河 (river = water + phonetic 可), 妈 (mother = female + phonetic 马)                |
| 5   | 转注 (zhuǎn zhù)     | **Mutually explanatory characters** | Characters with similar forms and related meanings, often variants or semantic shifts                  | 考 and 老 (related in form and meaning)                                           |
| 6   | 假借 (jiǎ jiè)       | **Phonetic Loans**                  | Characters borrowed to represent unrelated words with similar sounds; meaning evolves over time        | 来 (originally wheat, borrowed for "come"), 自 (originally nose, used for “self”) |

### Summary by Function

| Function Type              | Categories     |
| -------------------------- | -------------- |
| **Structural Formation**   | 象形, 指事, 会意, 形声 |
| **Usage / Semantic Shift** | 转注, 假借         |

---

### Notes:

* The first four types (**象形, 指事, 会意, 形声**) explain how characters are built.
* The last two (**转注, 假借**) deal with **semantic extension** and **phonetic borrowing**, focusing more on how characters are used rather than how they were constructed.
* **形声 (phono-semantic compounds)** make up **over 80%** of modern Chinese characters.

### Conclusion

The **六书** classification is not just a taxonomy—it reflects the **linguistic creativity and logical structure** behind Chinese writing. It shows how the script evolved from pictures and symbols into a flexible, sound-based system while retaining strong visual-semantic roots.



In Chinese characters (汉字), several structural phenomena or compositional patterns exist. 
Below is a categorized table of common structural types and phenomena beyond simple enclosures:

| **Phenomenon / Structure**          | **Description**                                                                | **Example Characters**            |
| ----------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | --------------------------------- |
| **Enclosure (包围结构)**                | One or more components enclose the others.                                     | 国、因、园                             |
| **Left-Right (左右结构)**               | Character is split into left and right components.                             | 你、明、树                             |
| **Top-Bottom (上下结构)**               | Character is split into upper and lower components.                            | 念、要、苦                             |
| **Left-Center-Right (左中右结构)**       | Three vertical components, side by side.                                       | 街、衡、御                             |
| **Top-Center-Bottom (上中下结构)**       | Three horizontal components, stacked.                                          | 意、壤、楚                             |
| **Semi-enclosure - Top (上包围结构)**    | Top encloses part of the character.                                            | 同、冃、写                             |
| **Semi-enclosure - Left (左包围结构)**   | Left encloses part of the character.                                           | 床、医、局                             |
| **Semi-enclosure - Bottom (下包围结构)** | Bottom encloses part of the character.                                         | 凶、凵                               |
| **Fully Enclosed (全包围结构)**          | Completely surrounded component(s).                                            | 囚、困、圆                             |
| **Overlapping (穿插结构)**              | Components intersect or interpenetrate each other.                             | 升、夹、巫                             |
| **Symmetrical (对称结构)**              | Balanced and often mirrored structure on the left and right or top and bottom. | 品、森、晶                             |
| **Stacked Identicals (叠加结构)**       | Identical radicals or components stacked for semantic effect.                  | 品、森、磊                             |
| **Phono-semantic Compound (形声字)**   | Component conveys meaning, the other conveys sound.                            | 河 (氵 for meaning, 可 for sound), 情 |
| **Associative Compound (会意字)**      | Components combine to suggest a meaning.                                       | 明 (日 + 月), 休 (人 + 木)              |

These phenomena contribute to the visual, phonetic, and semantic structure of Chinese characters. Let me know if you would like examples of characters broken down into radicals or strokes under these categories.


The structural phenomena of Chinese characters are not arbitrary; they reflect historical strategies in character formation and often imply something about meaning, pronunciation, or organization. Below is a table summarizing what each structural type *generally implies*:

| **Structure Type**                | **General Implication**                                                                                                      |
| --------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Enclosure (包围结构)**              | Indicates containment or boundaries; characters may relate to space, enclosure, or restriction (e.g., 国 = "country").        |
| **Left-Right (左右结构)**             | Often phonetic-semantic compounds (形声字); the left side typically implies meaning, and the right side suggests pronunciation. |
| **Top-Bottom (上下结构)**             | Similar to left-right; top part often conveys meaning, bottom part gives phonetic clue or completes semantic meaning.        |
| **Left-Center-Right (左中右结构)**     | More complex meanings or imagery; may imply a composite of multiple ideas or roles (e.g., 街 = 行 + 圭 + 彳).                    |
| **Top-Center-Bottom (上中下结构)**     | Often used for composite ideas stacked vertically; may reflect actions, scenes, or layers (e.g., 意 = sound + heart).         |
| **Semi-enclosure - Top**          | Suggests a cover or surface over an internal component; sometimes implies shelter, inclusion, or limitation.                 |
| **Semi-enclosure - Left**         | May reflect spatial orientation (left = inside or supportive role); often semantic on the left.                              |
| **Semi-enclosure - Bottom**       | Often denotes containment from below or support; fewer examples, may relate to foundations.                                  |
| **Fully Enclosed**                | Emphasizes isolation, confinement, or integrity; often used in characters involving boundaries or control.                   |
| **Overlapping (穿插结构)**            | Suggests interaction, interweaving, or complexity; components are integrated tightly.                                        |
| **Symmetrical (对称结构)**            | Aesthetic balance; often used in expressive or emphatic characters. Sometimes implies repetition or intensity.               |
| **Stacked Identicals (叠加结构)**     | Reinforcement of meaning; repetition strengthens the concept (e.g., 森 = "many trees", suggesting a forest).                  |
| **Phono-semantic Compound (形声字)** | Indicates that the character is built for clarity: one part gives meaning, the other pronunciation. \~80–90% of characters.  |
| **Associative Compound (会意字)**    | Built on conceptual logic: combining visual symbols to create a new, intuitive meaning.                                      |

These implications help readers and learners decipher unfamiliar characters, as the structural clues often suggest how a character should be read, what it means, or what family of characters it belongs to.
