ORACLE BONE SCRIPT 

Many characters from **oracle bone script (甲骨文)** continue to help 
learners of modern Chinese, especially by:

1. **Revealing the origins of radicals and core components**
2. **Clarifying meanings through pictographic or ideographic forms**
3. **Illustrating ancient cultural and cosmological concepts**

Early Chinese characters, particularly from the oracle bone script (甲骨文) 
and bronze inscriptions (金文), were indeed **predominantly pictographic 
and ideographic** in nature. These early stages of writing reveal how 
characters emerged from visual representations and abstract symbols 
to denote objects, ideas, and actions.

PICTOGRAPHIC VS. IDEOGRAPHIC

Pictographic: Characters derived from stylized drawings of real-world objects. e.g. 日 (sun), 月 (moon), 木 (tree)  
Ideographic: Characters representing abstract ideas, often through symbolic depiction.  e.g. 上 (up), 下 (down), 三 (three)

Compound: Some early characters combined pictographs and ideographs for extended meaning. e.g. 明 (sun + moon = brightness), 武 (stop + spear = military) 

While many characters originated as pictographs, the oracle bone script also included 
simple ideographs and early compound characters (also called huiyi 會意) that combined 
pictorial and conceptual elements. This combination reflects a sophisticated and evolving 
system from its earliest attested stage.

Thus, oracle bone script was primarily pictographic in origin but incorporated ideographic 
elements as part of a broader logographic system.

**Oracle bone script (ca. 1200–1050 BCE)** represents the earliest known form of Chinese writing, primarily used for divination. Characters were incised onto bones or shells and show clear pictorial origins.

**Bronze inscriptions (ca. 1046–771 BCE)** continued the development of these forms on ritual vessels, maintaining many pictorial elements while beginning to formalize structure and usage.

Most **radicals**—the semantic components used in forming more complex characters—stem from these early scripts and retain vestiges of their pictographic or ideographic roots, even as they evolved into more abstract forms in later script styles like seal script (篆書) and clerical script (隸書).




Here is a selection of characters from oracle bone script that remain valuable for understanding modern Chinese:
