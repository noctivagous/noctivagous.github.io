# Rillan AI Workflow Interface - MCP Integration Guide

## Overview

The Rillan AI Workflow Interface extension now includes **Model Context Protocol (MCP) server integration**, making it fully controllable by AI agents like Kiro. This means AI agents can programmatically generate forms, collect project details, and analyze requirements without any manual VS Code interaction.

Install the VS Code Extension
To install the extension in VS Code:

cd vscode-extension
npm run vscode:prepublish
code --install-extension 

Here's the complete command sequence to build, package, and install the VS Code extension:

# 1. Navigate to extension directory
cd vscode-extension

# 2. Install dependencies
npm install

# 3. Run prepublish (compiles TypeScript and runs linting)
npm run vscode:prepublish

# 4. Install vsce packaging tool (if not already installed)
npm install -g @vscode/vsce

# 5. Package the extension into .vsix file
vsce package

# 6. Install the extension in VS Code
code --install-extension rillan-ai-workflow-interface-0.0.1.vsix

# 7. Alternative: Install for development/testing
code --install-extension . --force

# 8. Optional: Start VS Code with extension loaded
code .
Quick one-liner for development:

cd vscode-extension && npm run vscode:prepublish && code --install-extension . --force && code .

If you get permission errors with global npm install:

# Use npx instead of global install
cd vscode-extension && npm run vscode:prepublish && npx @vscode/vsce package && code --install-extension *.vsix
The extension will then be available in VS Code's Command Palette with commands like:

Rillan AI: Start Detail Collection
Rillan AI: Show Detail Collector
Rillan AI: Start MCP Server



## üöÄ Quick Start

### 1. Configure Kiro to Use the MCP Server

Add this configuration to your `.kiro/settings/mcp.json`:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "fetch": {
      "command": "uvx",
      "args": ["mcp-server-fetch"],
      "env": {},
      "disabled": false,
      "autoApprove": []
    },
    "rillan-ai-workflow": {
      "command": "node",
      "args": [".../vscode-extension/mcp-server.js"],
      "env": {},
      "disabled": false,
      "autoApprove": [
        "analyze_project_context",
        "generate_detail_collection_form",
        "collect_project_details",
        "get_workspace_context"
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

### 2. Test the Integration

Once configured, you can ask Kiro to:

- **"Analyze this project request: Build a web app for task management"**

## üéØ Real-World Usage Examples

### Example 1: AI-Driven Project Analysis

**You:** "I need help building a mobile app for fitness tracking"

**Kiro automatically:**
1. Calls `analyze_project_request` to understand it's a mobile fitness app
2. Calls `generate_form_specification` with mobile/standard/collection parameters
3. Creates a form in VS Code with sections for:
   - App features and functionality
   - Target platforms (iOS/Android)
   - User authentication requirements
   - Data tracking preferences
   - Integration needs (wearables, health apps)

### Example 2: Investigation Workflow

**You:** "Our login system is really slow, can you help me investigate?"

**Kiro automatically:**
1. Calls `create_investigation_spec` with the performance issue
2. Generates an investigation form covering:
   - Performance symptoms and frequency
   - Affected user groups
   - System architecture details
   - Available monitoring data
   - Timeline for resolution

### Example 3: Refactoring Planning

**You:** "I need to refactor the payment processing module"

**Kiro automatically:**
1. Calls `create_refactoring_spec` for the payment module
2. Creates a comprehensive refactoring form with:
   - Current code issues and technical debt
   - Refactoring goals and constraints
   - Testing strategy and risk assessment
   - Timeline and breaking change considerations
