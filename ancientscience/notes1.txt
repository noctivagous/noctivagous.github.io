If you break a magnet in half, it has two north and south poles once again, just like Taiji.

When a magnet is broken or split in half, each resulting piece becomes a magnet itself with 
its own north and south poles. This occurs no matter how many times the magnet is split.

This can be used to introduce Taiji, which represents the foundational principle of
dualism in ancient Chinese science, where opposite forces are interconnected and interdependent 
in the natural world, forming a dynamic system in which the whole is greater than the assembled parts. 
Just as in Taiji, where yin and yang are present in each split half, in magnetism, 
both north and south poles appear in each new magnet created from breaking a larger one.

This duality is inherent in all magnetic materials. Magnets cannot have a single pole 
(a monopole does not exist according to classical electromagnetism). Each time you 
split a magnet, the molecular structure ensures that the magnetic domains within the 
material reorient themselves to maintain a north and south pole in each piece. 
This self-organizing characteristic of magnetic dipoles is essential for the 
continuation of the magnetic properties, much like the balance of yin and yang 
is essential for harmony in the philosophy of Taiji.
