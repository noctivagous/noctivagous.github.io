The Book of Changes can serve as the basis for researching a different
kind of AI.  For one, the 64 hexagrams provide a foundation for analyzing
the external and internal, but one does need to know Yin and Yang
accurately and study the hexagrams.  The Book of Changes is not limited
to the task of divination. The implications of the hexagrams are not
limited to predicting fortune.  The hexagrams allow for assessing 
external conditions, changes in them as well as making internal decisions. 
And since they are used for both, and they include the relationship between
what is outside and inside, the macroscopic and the microscopic scale,
they could serve as a means of harmonizing the external 
with the internal as the AI engages.  Also, the hexagrams can be computed directly,
as the trigrams correspond to binary numbers, which interested
the Western mathematician Leibniz, who devised calculus.  
This machine will not
need to respond in a static and deterministic way like today's
LLMs but can be operating continuously since it is based on the hexagrams
that have know pathways of change and transformation.  This is just
a speculative remark on how their use could be applied but its
principles are surely correct.

For the AI to be truly engaged with the world, 
it would face challenges of some sort like all of us do, 
so aligning it with the Book of Changes makes sense, as a computational
guide for action.  

In the process of acquiring knowledge there are 
revisions made to what one encounters.  The acquisition of knowledge
might be likened to revising one's own account of the path in
a maze.

When starting out research on an AI based on ancient Chinese science,
it is acceptable to start with just what can be put in the experiment-level
model to see what will happen.  Many qualities and associations with each element
of The Five Elements are possible, but from the outset it is not important to 
concern oneself with the associations being complete or already
linking into every ancient theory. Rather, getting the situation started and seeing
some progress with the theories is the goal.

What are the principles that drive modern AI?  It appears that it is
mainly its statistical predictions and interconnection of analyzed knowledge.
But will empirical science emphasize "interconnection" and progress
due to an inadvertently holistic configuration?  It won't, but we will. 

The Five Elements represents a model of processes for all things.  
The central set of principles is Yin and Yang for the machine, 
that there are phases of Yin and Yang in which one is in greater 
proportion than the other. When there is an excess or deficiency 
of Yin or Yang from within any of those phases, relative to the phase 
itself, the machine knows that this is a principle.  So from
the outset we have a balancing principle and we have a set of knowledge
gained from the ancient theories and we have means to compute
them.

Perhaps as data is taken in by the model, if this is how
it works, it will be organized and processed by the
the Luoshu, since the Luoshu can
access multitudes of associations of "reality" from the square,
and it relates to both the hexagrams and the Five Elements.

Any of these concepts and others can provide means to process
and categorize all things the AI comes into contact
with, all that it takes in, processes, and responds
with.  Its guiding principles that already know how
something should be balanced and evaluated will be computable within
existing statistical techniques and programming libraries
as they run on a GPU.  The recent developments in today's
computing technologies can run an alternative AI.  

Before embarking on this, two requirements are in place:
1) an understanding of ancient Chinese science in a way
that does not regard Yin and  Yang as symbol but instead real.
2) an understanding of current AI and the mathematics
and engineering behind it such that nothing significant
is missing.

We should, as people who know #1, be averse to the
techniques of modern AI that proceed
by way of volume: amassing enormous bodies of text
and feeding them into growing, expensive computational resources.
We know with certainty from our study of ancient Chinese science
that this is not the right path for any endeavor, 
though we may not have an alternative solution upon coming into contact
with what is working currently.    
The buildup of our AI will certainly take a different
path, perhaps one in which it gradually builds up and revises knowledge
from the core of deeper principles, which already start with
the essence of weather, taste, emotion, etc.  The basis of our
AI may not resemble current AI methods, but without being 
knowledgeable about them in the
beginning we would not be able to accomplish what we intend
because all the technologies we will use will be
rooted in the techniques of conventional AI and
that is the ideological direction in which they will continue
to develop.

Theirs is a process of development that may eventually
arrive at the right state, it does eventually make
the image or video that is like ones people shoot with
a video camera, but in the beginning their technologies
have alarming and basic problems, producing 
high-powered junk that is only moving towards 
less junk inside.
