Making an integer variable.

1. Make the variable code line.

   V key makes a variable reference box.
   D key makes a variable declaration box,
   which includes a box to the left to indicate)
   


2. Set the variable's type
 
    The cursor remains over the box (or exited and re-entered).
    
    The I key is pressed and this turns the box into an integer. 
    (The O key is for an object, etc.)

    -> An "untitled_int_variable" name is automatically made and shown 
    to the right.

4. Name the variable

    As long as the cursor remains hovered over the variable, typing
    will change the name of the variable.  Exiting the box
    finalizes the variable name.
    
5. Move the variable.

    Pressing the M key will drag-lock or "sticky drag" the variable
    for moving it inside the code until the M key is pressed again.
