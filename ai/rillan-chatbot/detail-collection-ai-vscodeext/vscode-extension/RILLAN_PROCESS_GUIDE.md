# Rillan Process Implementation Guide

## Overview

This VS Code extension implements the **Rillan Process Model** for AI-human collaboration, combining philosophical expert-client workflows with advanced AI control capabilities. It transforms traditional AI interactions from reactive responses to structured, programmatically-controlled consultation processes.

## Dual Innovation Approach

### 1. **Rillan Process Philosophy** 
Expert-client relationship patterns that provide structure and user control

### 2. **Dynamic AI Control**
Programmatic form generation and workflow orchestration that enables real-time adaptation

## The Rillan Process Model

### Core Philosophy

Instead of AI generating unpredictable responses from brief prompts, Rillan implements a three-stage process that mirrors professional consulting relationships:

1. **Preliminary Questions** - Like a landscape designer conducting a consultation
2. **Plans Notification** - Like an architect presenting blueprints for approval  
3. **Guided Execution** - Like a consultant working under client supervision

### Expert-Client Analogies

The system draws from proven professional consultation patterns:

- **Interior Designer**: Consults on style and needs, presents design options, refines based on feedback
- **Architect**: Gathers building requirements, offers blueprints, revises iteratively
- **Software Consultant**: Collects requirements, presents prototypes, iterates with feedback
- **Financial Advisor**: Evaluates goals and risks, presents investment options, adapts strategies

## Three-Stage Process Implementation

### Stage 1: Preliminary Questions

**Purpose**: Gather structured information before generating responses

**Implementation**:
- AI analyzes initial request for complexity and ambiguity
- Generates contextual forms ranging from quick 4-item menus to comprehensive questionnaires
- Uses appropriate interaction patterns (menus, decision trees, forms) based on consultation context
- Maintains user control over question modification and addition

**Example Flow**:
```
User: "Build a calculator"
AI: Presents menu with options for:
- Basic arithmetic vs Scientific vs Web-based
- Programming language selection
- Platform preferences (desktop, mobile, web)
- Feature requirements
```

### Stage 2: Plans Notification

**Purpose**: Present what the AI plans to do and allow modifications before execution

**Implementation**:
- AI generates detailed execution plan based on preliminary questions
- Presents plan summary with response format, length, structure, and approach
- Allows users to modify, reorder, add, or delete planned sections/tasks
- Offers preview samples when relevant (code snippets, design mockups, etc.)

**Example Flow**:
```
AI: "Based on your input, here's my plan:
• Create a scientific calculator in Python
• Include GUI using tkinter
• Add advanced functions (trig, logarithms)
• Provide error handling and input validation
• Generate documentation and usage examples

Would you like me to proceed, or modify this approach?"
```

### Stage 3: Guided Execution

**Purpose**: Execute with user oversight and transparency

**Implementation**:
- Display execution checklist with progress tracking
- Allow users to pause, modify direction, or provide guidance mid-process
- Provide post-generation tools (summaries, documentation, review aids)
- Generate overview tools for large outputs (diagrams, structured summaries)

**Example Flow**:
```
AI: "Executing plan with these steps:
✓ 1. Set up basic calculator structure
⏳ 2. Implement arithmetic operations
⏸️ 3. Add scientific functions
⏸️ 4. Create GUI interface
⏸️ 5. Add error handling
⏸️ 6. Generate documentation

[Pause] [Modify Direction] [Continue]"
```

## Key Features

### Decision Tree Navigation

- Menus remain available as tabs for revisiting
- Users can explore multiple paths without losing previous selections
- History tracking allows backtracking and trying different approaches
- Keyboard shortcuts for quick navigation

### Process Mutability Controls

The system supports mutability settings (0-10 scale) for different aspects:

- **Goal Mutability**: How fixed the end objective is
- **Step Mutability**: How flexible the path to the goal can be
- **Materials/Methods Mutability**: How much variation is allowed in tools/approaches
- **AI Generation Level**: How much the AI can create vs following fixed procedures

### User Modification Tracking

- All user additions and changes to forms are tracked
- Modifications are included in AI responses
- System learns from user branching behavior
- Process improvements based on user interaction patterns

## AI Control Capabilities

### Dynamic Form Generation
AI assistants can programmatically control forms by:

- **Context Analysis**: Calling `generateFormFromContext()` to analyze conversation and determine needed information
- **Custom Specification**: Using `generateFormFromAISpec()` to create forms with exact field definitions, validation, and layouts
- **Complexity Control**: Specifying form complexity (minimal, standard, comprehensive) with automatic adaptation
- **Real-time Modification**: Adjusting forms dynamically based on user responses and changing context

### Contextual Form Triggering
AI can automatically detect and respond to user needs:

- **Vague Request Detection**: Automatically triggering forms when users provide incomplete information ("make a calculator app")
- **Context-Specific Forms**: Generating investigation forms for bug reports, refactoring forms for code improvements
- **Proactive Collection**: Identifying missing critical information and creating targeted collection forms
- **Smart Suggestions**: Offering form-based collection when conversation indicates structured input would be beneficial

### Real-time Form Customization
AI has granular control over form behavior:

- **Layout Control**: Setting slideshow vs single-page layouts based on complexity and user preferences
- **Grid Configuration**: Configuring option displays with thresholds, columns, and user modification capabilities
- **Validation Rules**: Defining custom validation, required fields, and error messages
- **User Modifications**: Enabling and tracking user additions to option lists and form structure

### Response Processing and Workflow Orchestration
AI receives comprehensive feedback for workflow continuation:

- **Structured Data Return**: Receiving JSON-formatted responses in chat context with all user inputs
- **Modification Tracking**: Getting details on user additions, changes, and interaction patterns
- **Context Preservation**: Maintaining conversation history and form response data across workflow stages
- **Multi-stage Workflows**: Chaining forms together with branching logic based on user responses

## Integration with AI Chat Systems

The extension provides a complete AI control interface for chat systems (like Kiro):

### **Conversation Analysis**
```typescript
// AI analyzes conversation to determine form needs
const context = analyzeConversationContext(messages);
const form = await generateFormFromContext(context);
```

### **Custom Form Specification**
```typescript
// AI specifies exact form structure
const customForm = {
    title: "🔧 Code Refactoring Assistant",
    complexity: "comprehensive",
    sections: [...], // AI-defined sections
    slideshow: { enabled: true },
    customization: { submitButtonText: "Generate Refactoring Plan" }
};
const formId = await generateFormFromAISpec(customForm);
```

### **Response Processing**
```typescript
// AI receives structured response in chat
registerFormCallback(formId, (response) => {
    // Continue conversation with structured data
    continueConversationWithData(response.data);
});
```

### **Workflow Orchestration**
```typescript
// AI chains multiple forms together
const nextForm = generateFollowupForm(previousResponse);
const workflowState = maintainWorkflowContext(allResponses);
```

## Best Practices

### When to Use Each Stage

**Preliminary Questions**:
- User request is vague or ambiguous
- Project has multiple possible approaches
- Missing critical information for proper execution
- Complex projects requiring detailed specifications

**Plans Notification**:
- Before generating large amounts of content
- When multiple execution approaches are possible
- User wants to review approach before commitment
- Complex multi-step processes

**Guided Execution**:
- Long-running or complex tasks
