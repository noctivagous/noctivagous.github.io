ChatGPT Isn't Finished as a Software Application; It's a Simple Textbox Interface to an API

ChatGPT (GPT4) offers a lot of capabilities but the actual situation
is that it is just a superficial website gateway-- a plain text box-- 
for what OpenAI engineered for the computer data centers.   Originally OpenAI was just focused 
on selling access to that technical API (the API that communicates to the
LLM in the data centers).  Then it put together this chat format on a web page to interact with the API, in which the API responses come in after the user sends out text to the API.

According to official accounts,  ChatGPT is an accidental success; 
OpenAI originally released it as a "research preview". They
had no intention of marketing it commercially.  But then the public's interest 
in the interface to GPT3 exceeded expectations.

This ChatGPT type of interface was possible earlier, of course,
and there were people in previous years requesting an opportunity
to chat for free with an AI in this way, because all of the available 
options cost money.  Fortunately, OpenAI offered an option for people
interested in AI to try out interacting with their API for free, without
needing to write a program to make use of the API.  
OpenAI also succeeded with ChatGPT because it provided a 
high-quality LLM, GPT3. 

But what OpenAI may not realize is that as an organization it 
only has hired personnel to work on one side of the situation, the 
engineering of the AI in the data centers, and they do not have a team that intent on completing 
the ChatGPT app into something resembling a completed suite of features like an iLife app (such as GarageBand).  The natural evolution of ChatGPT would be this but for interacting with an LLM.  That is, ChatGPT isn't a suite a tools and OpenAI stopped at the text box that send API responses,
with the page stacking them as a "chat".

ChatGPT just provides a simple interface to the GPT's raw API that, previously,
few people except experienced programmers could use.  The "research preview"
transformed the situation by satisfying lay demand for free access to AI, but it wasn't built out,
it isn't a complete software package with a full, developed app experience, with ways to access
all of the use case scenarios of an LLM.  There are no nodes (patches) a person
can wire up to control its responses (such as Unreal Engine's Blueprints). Some people in the AI 
community have come up with their own independent apps with this feature for interfacing
to LLMs.
 
Apart from a text box, there is nothing guiding the user for how to use ChatGPT.
When we say that ChatGPT needs to be built into an app we
are saying that ChatGPT doesn't have any menus, toolbars, panels,
presets, templates, or generic prompts.  It isn't a finished app because it 
isn't a lifestyle app. So, there is no way the public can find this tool 
useful for very long unless OpenAI finishes the software.

At the most basic level, what ChatGPT needs is not just a few
specific examples to click on such as "Come up with a trip itinerary for me to visit
____" but instead a generic prompts: "Come up with a ___" or "Make an outline for ___".  
Then these would be divided into categories of use as well, such as 
for daily life, research, quizzing, etc.

Finally, typing text is not always the strongest means of controlling an LLM
at all times, because it depends on the use case.  If it is Dall-E, then there should
be preconfigured controls (such as the node-based programming nodes) with
adjustable parameters.
