(Yin and Yang) in The Natural Sciences

METEOROLOGY

“Hot and cold temperatures, slow and fast winds, high and 
low pressure, there is so much about meteorology that evokes Taiji.
Discuss the interplay among these factors that produces weather
conditions.”

PHYSICS

"Positive and negative, north and south, there is so much about 
electromagnetism that evokes Taiji.  Breaking a magnet
in half produces a magnet with two poles once again."

ZOOLOGY

"The bee (yang) and flower (yin) relationship is one of Taiji, 
as they are interdependent, with the bee being active and 
the flower being passive, a recipient, but the two rely on each other."


HUMAN PHYSIOLOGY

"The veins, blue, are carrying de-oxygenated blood 
(yin) back to the heart, carbon dioxide is transferred
to the lungs, and then after getting oxygenated the
blood is sent by arteries (yang) to the whole of the body, 
producing a circulation after every part of the body consumes the oxygen.  
when scientific study is isolated to the heart it is cardiology. 
when scientific study is isolated to the lungs it is pulmonology.  
yet the two organs are interdependent (taiji).  
the heart is relatively quick and fast  with its discrete
beats (yang) and producing circulation while 
the lungs' continuous breathing is drawn out (yin) 
and receiving air."
