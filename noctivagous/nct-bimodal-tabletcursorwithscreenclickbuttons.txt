A cursor exists on the tablet screen.
It takes the form of a 90pt x 90pt square, 
placed in front  of the finger.  It either only shows up
when the finger is in contact with the
screen or it stays in place on finger lift
until transported immediately by the next touch.

At the same time, on the left side of the screen 
there is a click button.  The left hand presses this
button on the screen to click while the right
hand moves the cursor.  So, touching the screen
is not always equivalent to clicking unless
an area is designated, which would be the click
button in this case.
