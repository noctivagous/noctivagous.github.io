				<h2>Introduction</h2>

				

				<p>Computer code files can be converted from plain text into a modern document format, allowing many features
					to be provided to programmers that are consistent with the present computing environment.
					Important to note, this will change the interface dynamic of the code editor.
					To ensure that the editing of a code document
					is speedy&mdash; as fluid as the editing of plain text code today&mdash; a user interface that is different from simple mouse-clicking of
					onscreen controls is discussed on this page.  It will emphasize the keyboard for interface control of code editing
					and a modified use of the mouse called the <b><a href="https://www.dfork.news/key-click-ui/">key-click UI</a> (demo)</b> by Noctivagous,
					which is made available for everyone.
<!--					The can continue to emphasize the keyboard for interface control of code editing and the editor's user interface.-->

				</p>
				<p>Below is an example <code>switch</code> statement converted to XML for a code document file format.  Immediately,
				all of the interactive capabilities that can be brought to XML are available for a <code>switch</code> statement and
				any other statement brought into markup.
				<p><img src="img/switchStatementInXML.png" width="100%"></p>

				<p>  The <code>switch</code> statement can
					be represented in any way needed and, instead of alphanumeric characters, 
					can be inserted as a keyword unit. 
					Many advancements will take place when code it translated into a document format.
					
					The appearance can be customized however preferred&mdash; including making the code
					behave exactly the way it does today in plain text.  Thus, there are no meaningful
					disadvantages to taking this path for code.
				</p>

				<p>More specific examples like the <code>switch</code> statement are located 
					<a href="https://www.dfork.news/programming/what-if-you-converted-the-c-programming-language-into-xml-file-format/">here</a> on dFork,
					a tech news website that is part of Noctivagous (January 2023).</p>

							<li>When computer code files are converted into a complete document format, this will 
								allow computer programming to advance past editing of plain text.  A document
								file provides more interactivity, it provides layout features, and it is edited by a modern software application. 
								A text file is the most basic format for an editable file.

										computer code.

									<ul>
										<li>Even if a programming language is artificially made to look similar overall
											as it did in plain text, the benefits provided by markup 
											are so large and numerous that there will be no going back.
												<ul><li>For example, management of individual parentheses and curly braces will
													be a thing of the past.
														<ul><li>curly braces are no longer typed or maintained because they are replaced
															with outlines of a box, and the boxes nest just like the items in this outline.
														</li>
														<li>parentheses are no longer typed individually because they are affixed 
															to both sides of the inserted text control.
														</li>
														<li>keywords like "function" or "var" are presented as single characters so that there
															is no dividing their characters up.
														</li>
														</ul>
												</li></ul>

									<li>
										There is no real disadvantage, as the code can be placed

										<i>Redesign.Codes</i> addresses this

										the <b style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">key-click UI</b>. It
										is a user interface	approach that 
										uses the keys of a keyboard for clicking. It ignores
										the mouse's click buttons completely, but uses the mouse for controlling the cursor.
										This provides greater control.
										<ul>
											<li>Keys of a keyboard act
												as the mouse's click buttons.  Try out a demo of the <a href="https://www.dfork.news/key-click-ui/">
													key-click UI here</a>.
									</li>
										<li>A second emphasis for the code editor is labeling elements
											and controls on screen with single-press key labels,
												(single-key-labels).  A single-key-label means pressing a key, without a modifier,
												that accesses a labeled control (tagged with that key). 
												<ul>
														<li>The entire layout of the keyboard changes.
														</li>

												</ul>
											</li>
											<li>Activating onscreen controls occurs much more frequently with
												the keyboard than the mouse, but the mouse is used to move
												elements around with the key-click ui.
											
											<li style="display:none">Text fields do not require clicking.  They are editable on hover
												and accept the entered data on mouse-exit.
														<!--

											<li STYLE="DISPLAY:NONE">
												In a future <i>Redesign.Codes</i> operating system, modifer keys are no longer used as

												discarded.  Instead, they are single-press keys that swap out single-key-press 
												keyboard layouts, with there being three keys available on any keyboard: alt, meta, and control.
												There is a keyboard layout for control, one for alt, one for alt + control pressed
												together, etc.  But they are not pressed with the regular alphanumeric keys.
												They are pressed sequentially with other keys.	To copy an item, it is a tap of the control key (swaps out keyboard layout), 
												then a press of the letter k.

				<!--
<p>
When there is a greater range of capabilities, they can
be interacted with by way of 
a UI model that Redesign.Codes calls 
the key-click UI.-->

				<h3>Full Summary:</h3>


				<p>
					All apps downloaded from an app store
					are made with plain text computer code&mdash;
					whether the device is a smartphone, tablet PC, or desktop computer.
					To address programming's reliance on plain text, <i>Redesign.Codes</i> explains how software
					development tools can add a new
					level of authoring to their editors:
					they can recognize
					<!--and interact with--> code files made out of markup.
					The markup sits underneath what is rendered inside the code editor.
					<!-- inside the file.-->
					When made the foundation of a code document format, markup
					will greatly improve the state of code, allowing it to become flexible,
					easily organized, and customizable.
					<!--
					Authoring a computer program with 

		 It is still displayed as code in the editor like before (not edited
		as markup).  -->
					<!--
		<p>The presence of markup will bring many benefits without
		doing any harm to a programmer. -->


				<p>
					Code can keep all of the existing editing control provided by plain text and then
					add a breadth of capabilities when it has been given an underlying structure, and this
					is easily provided by markup. The markup's structure is like the steel framing of an office building,
					allowing for all varieties of modern interior features to be added, whereas previously the walls
					were made of flat stones and cement mortar.

				<p>Once code is made out of markup, it is then
					rendered by the editor just like an SVG or web page, to provide two rendered markup examples.
					A more advanced editor will likely take on a form similar to a page layout document (e.g. Adobe Indesign or
					QuarkXPress document), but with much faster means of interacting with it.
				<p>
					Once the programming system behaves like an interactive, markup-based document (but tailored for
					app programming),
					interacting with it cannot stay completely the same as a plain text editor. That is, new features that are provided by the
					markup call for an additional approach besides just typing, so <i>Redesign.Codes</i> explains the
					<b>
						<a href="#keyClickUI">
							key-click UI</a></b>.

				<p>The key-click UI is named as such, to begin with, because
					the clicks of a mouse are moved to the keys of the keyboard, and then because the keyboard has more than three keys
					it provides many more clicks than the mouse. The keys click, not the mouse buttons.
					The mouse remains the physical device for moving the onscreen cursor. Doing this redistributes interaction
					with the computer by placing less of the user's physical activity on the mouse. During conventional dragging, for example,
					the user has to hold down a mouse button to drag <i>and</i> also coordinate the mouse's position, which is actually
					overloading the situation.		The key-click UI separates these two activities: the mouse moves the cursor while a key-click activates
					a drag on the object being dragged.  A key toggles dragging (a drag-lock), because a drag-lock works with the key-click ui
					whereas it did not with conventional dragging.  <!--In some cases, the key-click ui allows more than dragging.-->  "Dragging" thus becomes
					something very different.
				</p>

				<p>The key-click UI has been applied to software worked on by Noctivagous, the company behind <i>Redesign.Codes</i>,
					and its benefits are not just talked about here but have been put into an application for
					vector-drawing. 
					<!--It has also been utilized in a test computer application, a node-based app. -->
					In fact, that is where the key-click UI comes from,
					this vector-drawing program that is not yet ready for release, but which is far along in its goals.

<p>The name of the software is Floating Marker.  You can watch in the video below that the keys are actually taking
	the role of clicks.  The mouse buttons are not being pressed at all, but the mouse is being moved to control the cursor location.  
</p>

<p>
	<iframe  style="aspect-ratio: 163.1 / 108;width:100%;height:100%;"
	src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/JTjfK3A7_-0" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>
	</p>

				<p>For the task of programming, the key-click UI addresses a major, longstanding obstacle for upgrading
					computer code:
					there has always been a conflict between writing code in plain text
					and programming directly with a graphics-based user interface.

				<p>
					Before the vector-drawing program is made available, the key-click UI can be discussed today, because its applicability to
					nearly all other types of software became apparent in the course of making the software.
					There is no reason to hold back on talking about it because once it is made available in the
					vector-drawing software just mentioned, the world will likely take it up for many other types of software. 
					The key-click UI described on this page has been investigated over the span of years, 
					although it may look simple. If all of computers
					change for the better because of following the key-click UI of <i>Redesign.Codes</i>, that is a
					positive outcome because building vector-drawing software takes more than just having been shown the
					key-click UI.
					Noctivagous will be able to make software with a much preferable set of
					technological tools&mdash; in a much preferable technological environment&mdash; if the whole world adopts the
					key-click UI for software and code construction.
					<!--As it stands, using the keyboard to write code has always been considered the fastest.-->

					<!--Many programmers are even unwilling to use text editors that use a GUI.-->
					<!--devoted to command line
		text editors like vi or emacs.	-->
					<!--
		There has always been a conflict between editing code in plain text and the graphical user
		interface that uses the mouse to click on controls; many programmers are even devoted to using text editors 
		that sit in the terminal window.
		-->
				<p>
					The mouse has its purposes. But using the keyboard to write code has always been the fastest, and
					it is currently the only professional user interface available.
					Programmers don't want to program directly with a conventional GUI for very much of the code because it doesn't
					handle intricate situations well
					at all. But with the key-click UI, successfully changing the entire setup for interacting with
					computer code is now within reach.  Intricate code can be made and modified for the first time.
					The existing speed of computer interaction found in editing plain text code&mdash; that programmers
					rely on&mdash; will	be available in the more graphical computer code made out of markup.

				<p>
					With a combination of markup and key-click UI, conventional programming languages like C++ can just
					be transformed inside the code editor using document formats that are much more modernized.  
					Any programming language code file's extension can just have 'm'
					appended to distinguish its document format status from the plain text file.
					For .cpp files, .cppm would be recognized by the code editor as C++ code that should be compiled just like a .cpp
					file, but from a document format.  It can then be converted to .cpp from the .cppm.

				<p>
					Instead of reusing the old programming languages, it is also the case that
					a completely new system can be built from the ground up using toolchain technologies.
					<!-- into something accommodating of the programmer and useful.-->

					Therefore, no slow-down of the final, compiled product has to happen, which is another concern
					computer scientists bring up when discussing the addition of interactive or styled layers to code.
					It is not about adding a higher level of abstraction and thus providing a "no code" or "low code"
					situation.  Instead, it is about upgrading the document format that represents what  computer code is about
					in the editor.
					<!-- that has a GUI or styled features.-->
					<!--This is not about making a high-level programming language but instead a kind of GUI wrapper for existing code.
		
		-->
				<p>
					What is described on this page, which is translation of plain text code files into a document format, can serve as:
				<ol>
					<li>
						a means of converting existing programming languages to a more graphical and interactive form.
					</li>
					<li>making a new programming system from scratch that offers complex features found only in a document.</li>
					<li>making a code editor for a custom, markup-based programming
						language that "transpiles" (or is converted) to
						an existing plain text programming or scripting language.
					</li>
				</ol>
				</p>

				<!--
				<p>Many questions come up because what is the point of keeping the keyword <code>for</code> to represent a loop
				inside XML, when it is revealed that <code>loop</code> </p>-->

				<p>Once freed from the plain text format, programming with a document format moves towards a systematic setup, because all aspects
					normally considered external to the code files (e.g. GUI, images, etc.) that could not be shown in the plain text files
					 are integratable into the code documents.

					 <p>
					To give an example, the thumbnail of a GUI window may be located inside the code document, placed
					right next to the code that references it.  Clicking on it can just enlarge it for editing inside the document.	
					When  software development tools make use of documents, programming the more complex situations of today will be faster 
					and code will be much more manageable.</p>

				<!--<p>
		<p>But if you didn't have the key-click UI, the addition </p>

			Although mentioned for the purpose of editing code, 
		this key-click UI also can be provided in all software applications 
		that uses a mouse and keyboard.

					Key-Click UI: The Use of Keyboard Keys for Mouse Clicks</h2>





				<!--<h3>Clicks on The Mouse Will Happen on The Keyboard Instead</h3>-->

				<!--	<p>The Key-Click UI</p>-->

				<h3>Clicks on The Mouse Are Moved to The Keyboard</h3>

				<p>There are usually three buttons provided on a standard mouse: right click, left click,
					and middle click (by pressing the scroll wheel).
					On a keyboard, there are more than a dozen keys.

<!--
					These two button types (mouse button, keyboard key)
					are typically not associated with each other.-->
					If the programmer makes the keyboard key peform the mouse click&mdash;
					in place of the mouse's click button&mdash;
					he or she will gain a lot of user interface control in the software.
					The objective of the key-click ui is to leave the mouse buttons 
					alone when making the software and work up interaction around different 
					types of keyboard clicks.  Put differently, when the keys are used to click
					it makes the interactivity feel mechanical, unlike the existing setup.

					<p>
					It gets to be that there is a desire to change even the user interface controls on the screen 
					to avoid using the mouse click buttons.  This is a comprehensive strategy, 
					applied to the whole computer user interface.  The mouse buttons are not used except 
					to accommodate the times when people press them out of habit.
					<!-- The interface controls receive
		clicks performed by keyboard keys.-->

				</p>


				<h3>The First Convention of Key-Click UI</h3>

				<p>The first convention for this explained by <i>Redesign.Codes</i>, considered the first
					staple, is the following.  It is a configuration tested for vector-drawing software.
				<ul>
					<li>
						select a draggable object with the <kbd>tab</kbd> key.

						<ul>
							<li>The <kbd>tab</kbd> key performs what is currently <kbd
									style="aspect-ratio:unset">shift</kbd> + <kbd style="aspect-ratio:unset">left mouse
									click</kbd>.</li>
						</ul>

					<li>lock it to the cursor with the <kbd style="aspect-ratio:unset">spacebar</kbd> key.
						<ul>
							<li>wherever the cursor goes, the object goes because it is locked relative to the cursor's location.</li>
						</ul>

					<li> unlock it from the cursor when the user presses <kbd style="aspect-ratio:unset">spacebar</kbd>
						key again.

				</ul>


				<!--<p>
		<kbd>Tab</kbd> and <kbd>spacebar</kbd> are used specifically: they are easy to press 
		right away.-->
				<!--That's also true for the <kbd>escape</kbd> key, so in any situation
		<kbd>escape</kbd> also unlocks the selection.
	 
	-->




				<p>When the object's location is locked relative to the cursor, the programmer can operate
					with it by implementing other keys in the software. Since it's locked
					to the cursor, it moves wherever the cursor goes. Then the programmer is able to stamp it on the page
					with the <kbd> V </kbd> key (as an example key near the home row).
					It is possible to scale it with the bracket keys (<kbd> [ </kbd> and <kbd> ] </kbd>).
					It is possible to rotate it with the semicolon and single quote keys
					(<kbd> ; </kbd> and <kbd> ' </kbd>)
					that sit underneath
					the bracket keys. This is a tested keyboard configuration.
				</p>

				<p>So that multiple objects can be
					selected, the <kbd>tab</kbd> key implements what is currently <kbd>shift</kbd> +
					<kbd style="aspect-ratio:unset">left mouse click</kbd>. This allows the <kbd>tab</kbd> key to
					deselect, too.
					Just like before, it's possible to deselect individual objects one at a time or deselect everything
					by <kbd>tab</kbd>-clicking in a blank space. Making selections with the selection rectangle is
					discussed
					in the section below because it is converted to the key-click ui.
					<!--(This is a conversion of existing computer interaction
	to the key-click ui.)-->
				</p>

				<!--<h4>Variations of the Drag-Lock for different software applications</h4>-->

				<h4>Applying the Key-Click UI to an Online Map</h4>
				
				<p>Expanding the number of available clicks to what is on a set of keyboard keys can make
				the software more straightforward to use because it reduces the number of times
				that an additional menu of functions has to be displayed.

				<p>For example, in the case of an online map, the
					<kbd style="aspect-ratio:unset">spacebar</kbd> can act as the drag lock/unlock key
					for panning the entire map right away, with pressing it a second time unlocking the map
					from the cursor. This is much better than dragging the map while holding down a mouse button.
				
					<!--
				<p>The bracket keys can increase or decrease the zoom (the scale) of the map by a certain increment. 
					The <kbd>tab</kbd> key continues to select items on the map. But in the case of an online map,
					there are different functions a person can apply to the target of the cursor.
				-->

					<p>Online map websites aren't sure what you want with a mouse click or what you want to do with
						the location you are going to click on, so they open up
					an information panel and provide a menu of functions.  This is slow, comparatively.
					With the key-click UI, different key-clicks are mapped to those functions ahead of time
					and an onscreen keyboard is always showing them. 
					One key can just center the map.  Another key-click can open up the street view of the location 
					underneath the cursor.  The one next to it can add the address to a list, for collecting addresses
					of locations to visit.  Different keys can be designated to do different things, as there can be
					a dedicated map marker key that just lays down markers when it is clicked. 
					<!--Another can highlight just the zip code containing the point of the click.
					Another key-click can lay down markers. And then another can make vector-graphic boundaries on the
					map.-->
 <!--There just has to be an on screen keyboard.-->
				</p>

				

				<p>How do you collect items (locations, objects, coins, etc.) found on an online map and put them
					into a bin? You designate a specific key for this purpose and each item clicked on the map with the key is
					placed into a bin. 
					 	Sorting of items is
					now possible with the key-click UI, because at some point four or five keys
					can be designated to put items in four or five separate bins. The number pad is talked
					about in a section later, but actually it can be used for sorting items into 9 or more separate,
					predefined bins because each individual key's click places the object underneath the cursor
					into its own bin.
				</p>



				<p>As an additional comment, the web could also be organized this way in a custom urban planning format, 
					as all there is presented to the person is 
					a blank page, a list of bookmarked links, or a search engine box.  The web is there and it ought to
					be accessible in more ways than that since so much societal effort is put into it, after all.
					Different sections of the urban map or navigable environment sort 
					different aspects of the web.  But the representation does not have to look completely like a city.
					It can sit somewhere between a tree map kind of representation and a city environment.  There is at
					least then an overview of what this web contains, not just looking at a single website at a time.
				</p>

				<h4>
					Operating on an object Immediately without requiring a selection (or a drag lock)
				</h4>


				<!--<p>Different applications call for one of the main </p>-->
				<!-- After the selection was made, operations on the objects were made available, such as 
	the bracket keys are used to increase and decrease scale of an object.-->

				<p>As mentioned, the bracket keys are used to increase and decrease scale of an object,
					but it can be the case that they do this immediately to the object
					underneath the cursor. This is the other option: to operate on objects underneath the cursor
					without requiring that a selection be established first.
					<!--selection put into a drag lock. --> This is also true for the
					<kbd>delete</kbd> key: it can be
					the case that it deletes what is underneath the cursor right away.
				</p>

				<p>It depends on the software which configuration works optimally. It can depend on
					preference as well. It's also the case that the two modes can be offered and
					through a keyboard key a person can switch between them.
				</p>

				<h3>The Second Staple: The Selection Rectangle Is Established by the Rectangle's Interior Hypotenuse
					(using Two Key-Clicks)</h3>

				<p>
					The selection rectangle has the same appearance as the one in use today, that it sits at 90 degrees,
					but it is converted to the key-click UI by establishing two points with two key-clicks.
				</p>

				<ul>
					<li>key-click <kbd> S </kbd> establishes the first corner of the rectangle (point A).</li>
					<li>Point A is fixed. As the mouse moves around, the line extending from point A to the cursor
						(point B) is used
						to make a rectangle. It is the interior hypotenuse. As the mouse moves,
						the rectangle is updated (and the selection underneath usually updates as well).
						<ul>
							<li>Just like before, there are four quadrants the rectangle can sit in.</li>
						</ul>

					</li>
					<li>The second key-click <kbd> S </kbd> finalizes the selection underneath the rectangle and the
						rectangle
						disappears.</li>
				</ul>


				<p>
					Once there is a selection, it can be deleted as usual by pressing the <kbd
						style="aspect-ratio:unset">delete</kbd> key.
					But if the <kbd style="aspect-ratio:unset">delete</kbd> key is pressed to establish point B instead
					of <kbd> S </kbd> a second time, it can delete the contents selected by the rectangle right then
					(instead of just finalizing a selection).
				</p>

				<p>The selection rectangle also allows making a cropping rectangle for an instant zoom into
					a section of a map. It can also be configured to do a compound action of any other sort, such as
					selecting and copying, at the same time, any cluster of points that sit inside the rectangle.
					Multiple selection rectangles can exist that perform different types of functions, and they can be
					assigned
					separate keys that sit next to each other.</p>

				<h4>Selection Lines</h4>

				<p>A rectangle is one type of selection, but anything that overlaps with a line can be
					made part of a selection. The first type is just a single line, but there can be selection lines
					with
					multiple segments (also called a polyline), as long as the
					mode is continued.

				<p>For apps made by <i>Redesign.Codes</i>, modes begun with key-click are finalized with the END (<kbd>
						A </kbd>) key or
					they are cancelled with
					the <kbd> ESC </kbd> key. Alternatively, and depending on the software,
					a mode can be finalized with the same key that started it if there are only two key presses.
				</p>


				<h3>The Third Staple Convention: The Key-Click Drag-Line Replaces Holding Down the Mouse Button for
					Drag-and-Drop</h3>

				<p>The way it currently is with drag-and-drop, the mouse's click button is held down
					until the drop of the object onto the destination.

				<p>For keyclick UI, a key is not held down to drag and drop. It is pressed
					twice: the first key-click establishes what is to be dragged directly (underneath the cursor) after
					the cursor
					has been placed over it.
					When the mouse moves after that, the screen draws a vector line from
					the drag source to the cursor as it moves until the second press
					of the key.
				</p>


				<ul>
					<li>Key-click 1, <kbd> D </kbd>, establishes what will be dragged. It is point A of the drag line.
					</li>
					<li>As the mouse moves around and toward the drag destination, a line is updated from point A to the
						cursor (point B).</li>
					<li>Key-click 2, <kbd> D </kbd>, establishes where the dragged object goes (and it then goes there).
					</li>
				</ul>


				<!--
<p>In today's computers, drag-and-drop is initiated by the user inside an application, to cross from one application to another, 
	or it happens inside a file navigation window of the operating system.</p>
-->

				<p>
					Copying files instead of moving them is usually accomplished with the right click
					(or a modifier key is held down as the dragging takes place).
					Instead, on step 2 the copy key <kbd> F </kbd> can be pressed in place of the same key (<kbd> D
					</kbd>).


				<p>
					This situation allows extending the copy function to copy to multiple locations, because if the
					<kbd> E </kbd> key is used
					on step 2 this would allow hitting to multiple drag destinations (for copying) until the END key
					<kbd> A </kbd>
					or <kbd>ESC</kbd> is pressed.

					<!-- locations from if in the second step
	a different key is used from the first.-->

				</p>





				<h4>Example: a nozzle tool</h4>

				<p>
					To make a real-time nozzle tool that adds and subtracts
					particles, you can just designate a pair of keys like <kbd> N </kbd> and
					<kbd> M </kbd> to do that, and the cursor as it moves around can deposit particles underneath a
					circle brush.
					<kbd> J </kbd> and
					<kbd> K </kbd> might be the keys that thicken or thin the particles that you deposited.
					<kbd> U </kbd> and
					<kbd> I </kbd> can darken and lighten what was deposited. The location of these key pairs
					on the keyboard turns the computer into something like a real machine.

					<!--
While the particles are being built up with <kbd> N </kbd> and 
<kbd> M </kbd> , other keys can be made to
		change what is deposited in size and color, in real-time. -->
					The key-click ui allows for a real-time
					particle nozzle machine, in software.
				</p>

				<!--
	<p>
		This also shows how integrated a key-click UI-based app is:
		after a particle shape is made, it can then be selected
		with tab and spacebar.

	</p>-->


				<!--
<h4>In a Code Editor, Tab Views Activate Tabs on Hover</h4>
	-->


				<h3>Available Convention: The Key-UI Glove Cursor</h3>

				<p>The cursor is just an arrow. But actually, because of key-click ui, it can be made
					large and display 8 keyboard keys that correspond to 8 different key-clicks:
				</p>

				<div
					style="padding:10px;border:1px solid black;display: inline-block;border-radius: 10px;background-color:#999;">
					<div>
						<kbd> Q </kbd><kbd> W </kbd><kbd> E </kbd> <kbd> R </kbd>
					</div>

					<div style="margin-top:5px;margin-bottom:5px;">
						&nbsp;<kbd> A </kbd> <kbd> S </kbd> <kbd> D </kbd><kbd> F </kbd>
					</div>
				</Div>

				<p>
					The rounded, gray rectangle is a big cursor.
					So, it is a "glove" of clicking keys standing in place of the arrow cursor.
					As it moves around, it has various functions according to
					what is shown on the keys. Because what is shown can be programmed,
					many scenarios are opened for software.


				</p>

				<p>Optionally it can be left at 4 key-click UI keys:

				<div
					style="padding:10px;border:1px solid black;display: inline-block;padding-bottom:15px;border-radius: 10px;background-color:#999">
					<kbd> A </kbd> <kbd> S </kbd> <kbd> D </kbd><kbd> F </kbd>
				</div>
				</p>


				<p>It can also be made a full numberpad.</p>

				<div
					style="padding:10px;border:1px solid black;display: inline-block;padding-bottom:15px;border-radius: 10px;background-color:#999">
				
				<table class="pYr">
					<tr>
						<td> <kbd> 7 </kbd></td>
						<td> <kbd> 8 </kbd></td>
						<td><kbd> 9 </kbd></td>
					</tr>

					<tr>
						<td> <kbd> 4 </kbd></td>
						<td> <kbd> 5 </kbd></td>
						<td> <kbd> 6 </kbd></td>
					</tr>

					<tr>
						<td> <kbd> 1 </kbd></td>
						<td><kbd> 2 </kbd></td>
						<td> <kbd> 3 </kbd></td>
					</tr>
					<tr>
						<td colspan="2"><kbd> 0 </kbd></td>
						<td><kbd> . </kbd></td>

					</tr>

				</table>
</div>	

				<p>Key-click UI makes this a glove for a real-time machine.
					Each key can be given a specific role for the software it is used for. For example, the bottom row
					can
					made of clamps that pick up items, so there are four available places
					for items to be stored, moved, and dropped.
				</p>

				<ul>
					<li>keys in the glove can serve as mechanisms, such as one that holds an object and can rotate it in
						its holder</li>
					<li>keys in the glove can just operate on what is beneath them</li>
					<li>other keys on the keyboard, that are not part of the key-glove cursor, can be made to control
						and configure the glove,
						including swap out functions
						<!-- and fu nction sets-->, expand the layout spacing between keys, or even rotate the glove
						itself.
					</li>
				</ul>


				<p>Other keys can just be operations that operate on objects underneath them.</p>

				<p>In a numberpad based key-click glove, the keys can serve as 2D translation (XY) keys:
					<ul>
						<li><kbd> 5 </kbd> draws the object toward press number pad <kbd> 5 </kbd></li>
						<li>The other keys push away the object corresponding to their location.
							To translate the object to the right, press number pad <kbd> 6</kbd>.
						</li>
					</ul>

				</p>

				<p>In a numberpad based key-click glove, the keys can serve as 3D spatial translation (XYZ) keys:
					<ul>
						<li><kbd> 5 </kbd> pushes the object away from the viewer. <kbd> 0 </kbd> reverses. </li>
						<li>The other keys push away the object corresponding to their location.
							To translate the object to the right, press number pad <kbd> 6</kbd>.
						</li>
					</ul>

				</p>

				<h3>Implementing The Key-Click UI For Editing Code or For Any App</h3>

				<p>The key-click UI is flexible for making app interactivity: as the cursor moves
					around the document, it might not be stamping of a vector-graphics object
					that you do but instead insertion of a programming container into an area.
					What is helpful is that you can insert all kinds of programming containers
					using a single keyboard layout. If you want more than what is available on
					that keyboard layout, you can swap out different configurations. They are
					arrangements of key-clicks that you are swapping out.

					<!-- because you can change what the keyboard keys are made to do.-->

				<p>For today's computers, until a modifier like <kbd>control</kbd>
					or <kbd>alt</kbd> is pressed, keyboard keys primarily
					serve to enter alphanumeric characters, with the most frequent occurrence being text fields,
					multi-line text or single line.

				<p>
					This situation is inverted when the key-click UI is active:
					a plain key, without a modifer, performs an operation or function,
					and just like with stamping it pertains to where the cursor is located.
					Every key performs its own kind of click.

				<p>
					Whenever you change the layout of the keyboard, you have a new layout of commands
					because each key is a command and not an alphanumeric key for entering text.
					This is the main way a code editor can come about through key-click UI, because
					a lot of code can be inserted and edited in a mechanical kind of way.
					The keyboard is assisting in being a layout machine, with real-time operations
					that modify or add to what is underneath the cursor.
					<!-- Until now,
	a keyboard layout was always discussed in terms of a world language that the keyboard
	was switched to.-->

					<!--  or what mode the app is in. -->
				</p>

				<p>

					For inserting new computer code, when the keyboard layout is loaded, each key
					deposits a code element in the page. By just pressing the <kbd> I </kbd> key you can
					insert an integer variable, and with <kbd>U</kbd> you can insert a floating point variable.
					You can insert <code>if</code> statements and loops right away and define them much more quickly
					after
					they are in the page because you have the key-click ui to do that too.


				<p>
					This website says that an onscreen, live keyboard makes it so that the user of the software
					doesn't have to memorize every key of a keyboard layout because it is shown. Eventually
					the user does not have to look at the onscreen keyboard very often.
				</p>

				<p>
					<!--Insertion of code elements is just one keyboard layout type.-->
					On the loaded keyboard layout for insertion of code elements:
					<kbd> S </kbd> inserts a string
					variable, <kbd> F </kbd> can place a function in the code,
					<kbd> G </kbd> adds a <code>for</code> loop,
					<kbd> W </kbd> inserts an if statement and <kbd> E </kbd> inserts if-else.
					<kbd> T </kbd> adds an else-if area. <kbd> Y </kbd> adds a switch-case.
				</p>

				<p>After a variable or statement is inserted into the code (as if <code>int</code>
					had just been typed), it has to be edited. Because it is being inserted,
					it starts out with an automatically-generated name.
					To edit the name of a variable after it is inserted,
					all text fields are editable on hover. <i>Redesign.Codes</i>
					does not favor clicking inside small text boxes to activate editing,
					and it instead promotes "edit on hover" like below.
				</p>

				<div style="border:1px solid black; padding:20px;">
					<table style="margin-left:100px;">
						<tr>
							<td><span class="variableKeywordStyling"
									style="border-radius: 5px;border: 1px solid black;padding:3px;"> int </span></td>

							<td valign="middle">

								<input value="cardboardBoxes"
									style="background-color:rgb(156, 113, 113);border-radius: 5px;"
									onmouseover="this.focus();this.select()" onmouseleave="this.blur()"
									class="dataInputList">
							</td>

							<td valign="middle">= </td>

							<td valign="middle"> <input value="20" onmouseover="this.focus();this.select()"
									onmouseleave="this.blur()" class="dataInputList">;</td>

						</tr>

					</table>
				</div>

				<p>The benefits of moving away from mouse clicks
					extends to all user interface controls: if a text field is for
					numeric values, just press the bracket keys while the cursor hovers over it in order
					to increment or decrement the value. (This aspect of the numeric field is not yet implemented above,
					but it is in the software <i>Redesign.Codes</i> is working on.)
					You can do that for slider controls too,
					either circular or linear. Just hover over the slider and it moves when
					you press a bracket key. If you tab-click a specific location in the slider,
					it goes there right away and this is better than clicking with the mouse.
				</p>

				<p>For the thickness of a selected vector line, <kbd>-</kbd> and <kbd>+</kbd> are used,
					and they sit above the bracket keys.</p>

				<h3></h3>

				<!--
<p>
		For the future of computer code editing and interacting with software in general,
		there is a major opportunity of improvement 
		to use the mouse peripheral solely for moving the cursor around.
  The mouse is given the exclusive role of coordinating the cursor's location.  
  Then, as a programmer, you designate clicks as keys on the keyboard.  
-->


				<!--
	<p>
		
		Your clicks are done with the keyboard keys while you move around the mouse.  
		And you don't press a button on the mouse.
	-->

				<!--
  <p>
	This actually has multiple effects, including improving the experience of
	dragging objects on screen.
	Because of the key-click UI, dragging can replaced by something Redesign.Codes calls <i>carting</i>.  
	In short, the object is locked to the cursor and moves with the cursor as you move the mouse around,
	Then it is dropped (unlocked from the cursor) when you press the spacebar.
	And when carting is turned on, a variety of operations are available.
  </p>
    



	

		-->
				<p>
					Clicking and dragging objects with the hand fatigues
					the hand by comparison, and after clicks and dragging are moved
					off the mouse and placed onto the keyboard, a person will not feel
					that holding down buttons on a mouse or trackpad are nearly as good
					as the key-click UI. The person will wish that all
					websites, operating systems, and software implemented this approach. And fortunately
					it is compatible with all computers in use today. It just has to be implemented
					in software.

				<p>
					Setting up clicks to exist as various keys on the keyboard in place of mouse buttons
					provides a leap in UI handling and control for the user of the computer (handling as in how a car's
					controls
					make the car handle curves as it moves around a road).
					And when an entire keyboard of keys acts as a set of separate clicks, this
					expands the range of real-time operations available at any period.
					Software takes on the form of machine interactions, which is more conducive to fluid interactions
					with the computer by many times.


				<p>
					Using the click on the mouse will happen, though, because it
					is the habit promoted by all computers everywhere.
					When you do end up hitting a mouse button on your own, it will
					be accommodated by Redesign.Codes.



				</p>


				<h3>In a Key-Click UI, The Utility of the Keyboard Is Not Limited to clicking</h3>

				<p>The keyboard is powerful, which is why so many people use the command line,
					because entering a command in the command line it breaks out of any slowdown or
					nonsense that came about suddenly in a GUI.

				<p>
					What can continue across the system is not only clicking with keys
					but another situation which is leaving the mouse stationary.
					<!-- This is not the same as a program
		that is driven by the keyboard shortcuts in the terminal.  -->
					In this case, the software application
					is programmed for dynamic interaction with the keyboard based on
					what is happening inside the active software application.

				<p>
					<!--It is not a terminal program but instead GUI: -->
					Anything that would have been clicked has a label affixed to it for which key
					will activate it, and these labels may change according to the states of the
					app or what its documents are doing. No software does this, but it
					resolves a longstanding tension between GUI and keyboard shortcut
					control of a computer.

				<p>
					For example, it is the view of <i>Redesign.Codes</i> that a better web browser can exist
					that does not make a person move the mouse or click on the page.
					<!-- It's actually tedious to click links.-->
					In this web browser, a computer user does not have to move the
					mouse to click a specific link.
				<p>
					There are multiple ways to do this, but the numberpad overlay grid is discussed below.

					<!--
		because the link is either labeled with a 
		key name to activate it or it is part of a list of links sitting to the right of the page that
		are updated.  In that list, the keystrokes to press that activate links 
		are updated in real-time according to what section of the page is in frame.
		
	
		<p>
		The labels do not have to be on the page at all times and can
		be turned off and on with a keystroke, but established regions of the screen, such as
		dividing the frame into thirds from top to bottom, will let the link labels be known in
		advance because the labels will sit in frames. People who use this browser would 
		have already accepted that elements sit on top of web pages that are not part of the page itself
		and not worry about it fitting a so-called "clean" UI where there is nothing but the output
		found in print media; this is a computer, so some acceptance of computer elements that provide
		interaction between the user and the computer, sitting on top of what is provided in physical 
		print media, would be the established norm.  Web browsers have typically imitated print
		media, but at all times the user could just regard a web page as a part of the digital experience,
		and this will open up the computer for an improved digital life.
		</p>

		<p>
		All control of the web browser will come from the keyboard.
		This would occur to the extent that everything in a web page
		is set up such that replying to a specific comment in a specific part of the page
		occurs without moving the mouse over to the area and clicking "reply". Neither
		are any text areas clicked because this is also activated with keys.
		
		

	-->

				<h4>Using the Key-Click UI to Activate Individual Cells in Rows of Tabular Data</h4>

				<p>
				<ul>
					<li>Hover the cursor over a row (of a table of data).
						<ul>
							<li>
								Each cell of the row, starting
								from left, is labeled with a key from the keyboard that activates it.
							</li>
							
								<li>These labels are the same for each row when mouse has hovered over it.
							</li>

							<li>
								A viewer box can be placed to the right of the table, and when
								a cell is activated it loads its associated data into the viewer box.  This allows for
								rapidly going through media, including photos, text, 3d models, and movies.
								It could be names of the media or thumbnail previews.
								<ul>
									
									<li>
									The table can be longer than the height of the view but then
									it needs to have scrollbars so that the viewer stays in place.
									Alternatively, it can be paginated into sections that are mapped
									to the regular number keys.
								</li>
								</ul>
							</li>

							<li>
								The key-click UI is flexible because what is done to the cells can
								be changed.
								<ul>
									<li>Activating a cell can append its contents to another area
										(a clipboard-like area) instead of view its associated data
										in a viewer.
									</li>
									<li>
										More than one key label can sit underneath each cell, and
										the keys can activate different functions on the data.
										<!--<ul><li>copy, paste, </li></ul>-->

				<h4 id="numberPadBasedUserInteractionGrid">The Number Pad-Based Interactive Grid</h4>

				<!--
		<p>The number pad is an example where the supposed
			contradiction of either
		</p>-->

				<p>
					For either file navigation or browsing a page of hyperlinks,
					the number pad (also called "numpad") is a GUI user interface requiring no mouse movement,
					just keyboard interaction. It has relevance to browsing files
					on the file system or accessing data trees. On a web page,
					it allows speedy navigation to hyperlinks regardless of where they
					are located on the page; the web page does not have to have been
					designed in tandem with this navigation scheme.
				</p>


				<h4>Web Browser Navigation Based on the Number pad and Its Overlay Grid</h4>


				<p>
					When <i>Redesign.Codes</i> applies the numberpad interactive grid,
					there are 9 divisions made of the viewport of a web browser. They
					correspond to the 9 keys on the numpad. This is the overlayed
					3x3 grid.
				</p>

				<ul>

					<li>As the person browses a web page,
						the numpad grid overlay is usually hidden.
						Optionally, its intersection markers can be present.

					</li>


					<li>

						Pressing any number pad key makes the overlay grid visible
						and it is labeled with numbers of the number pad.
						<!--(if it is hidden)-->.
						<!-- (in whichever mode, be it intersection
			markers or all of the grid lines being there).-->
					</li>

					<li>The viewport of the web browser is then divided into 9 cells with the overlay grid.
						It is then possible to access a desired hyperlink because it is sitting in one
						or more of the 9 cells.
					</li>
					<li>
						Pressing the number pad key corresponding to the grid cell where the hyperlink
						is located will activate that cell by placing letters over each hyperlink
						<!-- contained
			in that cell-->, starting with ASDF, then QWERTY, then ZXCV, all the way across the keyboard.



					</li>

					<li>
						Pressing the letter on the keyboard corresponding to the link
						activates the link and the overlay grid disappears or returns
						to just being intersection markers.
					</li>

				</ul>


				<p>In a mode that is not activating hyperlinks, this is also a means of accessing and making use of
					non-hyperlinked elements on the page without having to move the mouse or clicking the elements.
					If a web page element is accessed, it can be immediately placed into a custom
					clipboard with a different keystroke
					<!--(not the conventional copy and paste)-->.
					It can also be zoomed in on because it has been accessed.
				</p>

				<p>
					In the above description, the viewport is divided once with the 9 cell
					grid and then alphanumeric labels are generated for the hyperlinks
					inside an activated cell.
					But in an alternative navigation scheme for other scenarios (besides web browsing),
					the activated cell is subdivided with a new 9 cell grid.
					<!--it can also be the case that the cell, when it is activated,
		is divided again with a 9 cell numberpad grid.
	until the hyperlink is accessed by a number label.
	-->
				</p>

				<p>
					For many users making use of a web browser, interaction with tabs is a frequent activity.
					So the other keys on the number pad can be made to move between tabs.
					Also, what's called the "target" of the hyperlink,
					<!--the mode for activating the hyperlink-->
					whether to open it in a new tab or in the current window, can be changed with
					the other keys on the number pad.
					<!-- that are not numbers, like -, +,
			/, =.--> Usually it is a modifier key on the keyboard
					pressed at the time of a mouse click that changes the "target" of the loaded
					hyperlink.
				</p>

				<p>In a web browser, <i>Redesign.Codes</i> expects the zero key to be used for changing
					(toggling) the number pad key layout, turning it into controls
					for interactive elements on the web page, particularly controls for videos.
					When it is used for interactivity, the period <kbd> . </kbd> key can be used as escape while the
					<kbd> enter </kbd> key
					can be used for OK.
				</p>

				<p>Importantly, a person while web browsing does not have a feeling for how much is on the page, or how
					long the web page is, and a version of this can be used for accessing A4 or letter thumbnails
					of the web page.
				</p>

				<h4>Numberpad Websurfer</h4>
				<p><i>Redesign.Codes</i> is providing a Chrome extension that demonstrates the use of a interactive numberpad grid,
					in this case for web browsing.  It is called <a href="/nsurfer/">Numberpad Websurfer</a>.</p>

				
				<ul>
					<li>Numberpad Websurfer lets the user hit links or enter text fields.</li>
					<li>It shows that the back and forward buttons should be single press keys (without any modifiers).
						
						<ul>
							<li>Modifier connotes "extra".  But back and forward are commonly pressed, so they should be keys.</li>
							<li>Requiring a modifier key for frequently accessed commands produces a high level of interface friction.</li>
							<li>When the back and forward buttons are single press keys, the computer behaves
							more normally. </li>
								<ul><li>This is also the case for tabs, that moving between them should involve dedicated keys without modifiers.</li></ul>
						</ul>

					</li>
				</ul>

				<p>In the case of Numberpad Websurfer, what is tagged onscreen are links and clickable page elments.  But if
					an onscreen element has one tag for clicking links it could have
					another for executing an operation on it.  If the interactive grid were applied to the entire computer screen,
					for example, one tag (key label) applied to the window would make it active while another would close it.
					If the interactive grid were used for file navigation, one could open it while another moves it to the trash.
				</p>

				<p>There is another scenario in which underneath the cursor and affixed to its location is very large roaming semi-transparent
					selector, about 400px by 400px, and the key-label tags are updated in real-time as the cursor moves.  In the case 
					there are about 9 or fewer elements underneath the cursor, the cursor is moved and the numberpad keys are used to click.
					The zero key could be used in this scenario.  Numberpad plus and minus can operate on what is underneath the roaming
					sem-transparent square as well, such as scrolling down and up.  This will allow navigating through file systems quickly.
					Or it will allow operating on displayed data.  It may be applied to photo editing.

				</p>


				

				<!--
		<p>The number pad also has applicability to 3D software.  
			A 3D plane can be divided into the same grid, and the number pad can be accessing the objects in the 3D space starting from a horizontal plane,
			because it sits underneath all of the objects.  When a certain grid of the number pad, lying on the horizontal plane, is
		activated, a rectangular transparent solid extends from that cell upwards.</p>



		any rect
		
	
		-->

				<p>The numberpad makes it possible to navigate tree maps (diagrams) without moving the mouse or clicking
					with it. If a numberpad grid is overlayed, or placed on top of, a tree map, it can access any part
					of the
					information.
					<!-- So at some point it might be utilized inside the web page on various elements, like a tree map.-->
					Other types of diagrams can have a numberpad overlayed as well. This then makes it possible to
					navigate these types of diagrams live, in real time, as opposed to just clicking.
				</p>



				<p>Select an element inside a software application or on a web page to apply it to,
					such as a geographic map on a website page
					that was not designed for it. If the software that provides this grid can be programmed
					with macros, a lot of software can be made much more natural to navigate and traverse.
				</p>

				<p>In a plain click-based numberpad grid, the objective is to center the click in the middle
					of the activated cell as the subdivisions are navigated, until the <kbd>enter</kbd> key is finally
					pressed.
					That's because clicks require different levels of accuracy, depending on whether it is an image
					being clicked or a button, hyperlink, etc.
					<!-- After a click has been established it can be stored.-->

				</p>

				<h4>A Three-Part Configuration for a Number Pad</h4>

				<p>The numberpad allows for many layout configurations in the following 3-part setup:</p>

				<ul>
					<li>
						An onscreen number pad (a resizable panel window).

					</li>
					<li>The regular row of number keys changing what the number pad does (determining which layout is
						loaded).</li>
					<li>The onscreen number pad changing according to which
						layout was loaded from the regular row of number keys.</li>

				</ul>

				<p>For an app, there are then 10 possible use cases for the number pad's 9 keys
					and the user only has to press a regular number key (or, in some cases, a regular number key in
					combination
					with a modifier key if the regular number keys need to be used for text).
				</p>

				<p>Operating systems are usually displaying the applications in a single row,
					but if there are only 9 open, the number pad can act as the "dock" or "task bar"
					because just pressing a key corresponding to the application image will open it.
					In the case there are more than 9 open, the grid can be subdivided, with more
					than one application image sitting in a single grid cell.
				</p>

				<p>Furthermore, the regular number keys can, after an application is activated,
					open up a window from that software because the windows are labeled with
					numbers.
				</p>

				<h4>Labeling Windows with Numbers for the Numberpad</h4>

				<p>

					Although it is not done, all windows on screen could be
					provided numbers as labels in their titlebars,
					and by entering a number on the number pad key that specific
					one could be made the active window.
				</p>
				To activate the window manipulation mode,
				just by pressing the asterisk in the upper righthand corner of the number pad,
				the number pad can be made to manipulate all windows on screen, accepting entry of the number
				corresponding to the window. The number pad's layout also is evenly divided
				into 9 sections like how a person would want to position (or resize) windows.

				<p>
					Once made the active window by pressing a numberpad key, a drag-lock
					can be applied or functions that resize or move the window.
					In particular, at the current time <i>Redesign.Codes</i> is investigating
					collapsing windows into vertical strips. That is the window is, instead of being
					collapsed into its title bar (like has been done in a certain OS years ago),
					it is collapsed into a vertical bar that is the same height as the window or a standard height.
					The title of the window would of course be displayed vertically inside the strip.
					This then allows stacking multiple vertical strips on the left of the screen and even moving
					onscreen windows to the right. Because they are vertical bars, they can
					be grouped as well and have a single label indicated which software application
					they belong to on screen.

				</p>


				<p>
					It is also the case that modifier keys like <kbd>shift</kbd> and <kbd>control</kbd>
					can be applied to the number pad:
				<ul>

					<li>When the number pad is the means of accessing or activating the 9-cell regions of a viewport:
						<ul>
							<li><kbd>shift</kbd> + number can activate multiple
								regions of the grid corresponding to the number pad. It can be followed by the
								<kbd>enter</kbd> key.
							</li>
						</ul>
					</li>

				</ul>

				<!--
			<ul>
				<li>It can make it so accessing number do not extend beyond one digit.</li>
				<li>It can apply a certain operation to the selected windows.</li>
				<li></li>

			</ul>
		For example, a <kbd>shift</kbd> press could apply one operation
		to a certain.
		</p>-->

		<h4>Using the Numberpad for Video Games</h4>
		
		<h5>Jumping away from antagonists</h5>

		<p>If character is a block, the block is immediately transported
			to the center of the pressed grid cell, to get away from
			chasing antagonists.  Smaller movements are done with the arrow keys in tandem.
			
			If the next numberpad key the pressed is done within
			1 to 2 seconds, it is the subgrid of that cell.  In a different setup, the
			arrow keys refine which subgrid cell the block goes to once it is
			inside the grid cell.  But the arrow keys allow moving the block over the cells.
		</p>


		<h5>If controlling an object in 3D:</h5>

		<p>The 5 key moves an object or the 3D scene's main camera away from the viewer.</p>
		<p>The 0 key moves an object or the 3D scene's main camera away toward the viewer.</p>
		<p>The regular keys serve as functions for the main object(s) of the protagonist, such
			as the ship.
		</p>
		<p>The keys around the numberpad 5 key act as directional keys, as force on the main
			objects.</p>

			

		
		<h4>Substituting the Regular Number Keys for The Numberpad (For Laptops and Reduced-Size Desktop
					Keyboards)</h4>

				<p>The numberpad keys are in a normal grid and for this they match different areas of
					an onscreen rectangle that would be accessed.
					But since the rows of the regular keyboard keys are offset, one after another,
					using a group of them as substitute numberpad keys does not work well for the interactive
					purposes described above.

					<!--
		<p>When the keyboard does not have a numberpad, such as on a typical laptop, it is preferable not
			make the regular keyboard keys behave in the same layout as the numberpad. -->
					<!-- The onscreen layout is just one row of rectangles.-->

				<p>
					Instead, the onscreen subdivision can take place 
					<BR/> <kbd> U </kbd> <kbd> I </kbd> <kbd> O</kbd> <kbd> P </kbd><BR/>
					<kbd> J </kbd> <kbd> L </kbd> <kbd> L</kbd> <kbd> ; </kbd>
					
					<!--in one dimension, horizontally, matching
					the regular number keys on the regular keyboard. There are then 9 (or 10) rectangles in
					a single row on the screen, spanning left to right. They match the
					<kbd> 1 </kbd>-<kbd> 9 </kbd> keys (and then optionally the <kbd> 0 </kbd>
					key as well).-->


					<h4>Numberpad Used for Adding in a Direction</h4>

					<p>
					The arrow keys are considered "directional" in that
					they moved the object a certain direction.  
					They move a selected item.  They don't add anything to the page.
					

					<p>
					The numberpad key can add objects to the page, in the direction
					that the number pad key represents.  It can add squares in that direction.

					<p>If it is used for moving an object, it can move it directly 
						into the position of a rectangle.

						<ul>
								<li>manual sorting:
										<ul
										<li>The object to be sorted sits in the middle
											(where the 5 is) of an onscreen numberpad.
											Nine positions are allowed for sorting.



										</li>

										</ul>
							
								</li>

								<li>file navigation:

									<ul
									<li>8 folders surround the middle.
									</li>

									</ul>

								</li>

						</ul>

					</p>

				<h4>Roaming Numberpad Frame on a Larger View of Cells</h4>

				<p>The numberpad grid can be a roaming frame on a large
					table of cells.  The table can be divided
					into sections so that the numberpad frame 
					can be translated by more than one cell per increment.
					The arrow keys can increment by one cell.
				</p>

				

				<h4>Eventual Moving Away from Clicking on Controls</h4>

				<p>
					In the 1980s when the GUI was new, clicking buttons and menus was interesting to everyone.
					But actually, there is too much work required to click a window's close button
					because it is small. <i>Redesign.Codes</i> has found that after
					the implementation of key-click UI in software, there is a trend that emerges
					where eventually it seems preferable to avoid clicking buttons and controls.
					It seems instead that they should be labeled with keys, accessed with those keys,
					and then manipulated with other keys.
					That's also true for controls like sliders.
					<!-- the key-click UI reduces a lot of the friction anyway
		before a UI scheme can be implemented that avoids clicking on controls.-->

				<ul>
					<li>
						The key-click UI is used for manipulating objects in the page that
						need to be deposited, manipulated, scaled, operated on in real-time. It is manipulating
						objects during production of an end-product.
						<ul>
							<li>It can also be used to click on controls of the software.</li>
						</ul>
					</li>
					<li>Controls like sliders seem as though they should be accessed and
						controlled by the keyboard (or other device), with the system generating key labels
						all the time for every onscreen control.
					</li>
				</ul>

				<p>In today's computer systems, all objects on screen are clicked, regardless
					of whether they are controls for the software or
					objects that are part of an end-product during production.
					<!-- A text area inside a page of a document is not always regarded by Redesign.Codes as the same
			as a text area inside a properties window.-->
				</p>


				<!-- <p>When the mouse came about, it served to control and interact with whatever
			made up the mass of pixels on a computer screen.  But once the key-click UI
		is made use of, it becomes the case that differen objects on screen play different
	roles: a slider for changing parameter values is not the same.</p>
<p>Not everything on screen is going to be drag-locked to the cursor, such as sliders
			that sit in property windows.</p>
-->

				<!-- but it isn't always easy to achieve this
		because of how the contemporary computer GUIs are built up.-->

				<!--		
		of the page to where
		the comment is.  
		-->

				<p>For navigating to controls, moving the mouse followed by key-clicking does not need to occur.
					Instead, elements onscreen like text areas and buttons can be labeled.
				</p>
				<p>All hyperlinks on a web page are actually buttons
					and "browsing the web" involves clicking lots of buttons that
					are perceived as merely underlined text. If a person
					thought they were all buttons, the computer user would look
					at "browsing the web" very differently.</p>

				<p>This navigational technique then applies to editing code because
					programming, too, does not have to always involve constant movement of the mouse.
					There are times when the code editor can label
					elements in the page of code so that highlighting a desired
					area (for editing) is immediate.
					A combination of both is helpful because with code
					it is about manipulating code elements, but when
					browsing the web it is about navigation through
					the information.

				</p>

				<ul>
					<li>A web browser is usually about navigation of information.
						<ul>
							<li>So less mouse movement would be desired.</li>

						</ul>
					</li>
					<li>A code editor is usually about manipulation of code elements
						and navigation to them.
						<ul>
							<li>So a combination of mouse movement and periods when
								the mouse is used less would be desired.
							</li>
						</ul>
					</li>

							<Br /><Br />

								<li>

									<p style="font-size:30px;font-family:sans-serif">
										<i>Redesign.Codes</i>
										<!-- regards the mouse's click as an overstressing button, and--> moves
										the click off the mouse, assigning it to keyboard key(s) instead. This allows
										for a very different, expansive dynamic
										to come about. (The mouse serves only to move the cursor.)
										<!-- and the keyboard can do a lot to act like a machine-->
										</b>
									</p>
									<!--<p>The mouse has always turned your hand into a kind of penguin hand, with the arrow cursor being your
				penguin hand onscreen. </p>-->
									<ul>

										<li>
											<p style="font-size:30px;">
												When a computer stops making the mouse hand do two things
												at same time (coordinate the cursor <i>and</i> make clicks on the mouse
												device),
												dexterity of computer interaction is greatly improved.

												The increment fatigue that occurs from clicking is relieved from
												the user's right hand (for right-handed users). The left hand manages
												clicks, on the keyboard.
												The two hands then work together in separate locations to achieve goals
												quickly, reminiscent of operating a sewing machine (the sewing speed is
												controlled by the foot on a pedal and the
												stitching is maneuvered by the hands, an example of better machine
												interaction from the body).
												<!--The user learns that because that is too
									much.-->

										</li>

										<li>
											<p style="font-size:30px;">
												A new setup that the computer industry
												has not seen comes into software this way. In a vector-drawing
												application,
												it allows for an immersive, machine drawing environment.
												(But a vector-drawing program has to take care of a myriad of details to
												make that amount to a complete package
												of software, because it goes beyond changing the mouse click to keyboard
												key clicks.)
												<!--
									Dexterity of computer interaction is unmatched
									when the mouse device is dedicated to controlling the screen's cursor and the click(s) are
									moved to the keyboard keys.-->
											</p>



										<li>
											<p style="font-size:30px;">
												A typical mouse is limited to only three click types (left, middle,
												right).
												When the keyboard keys replace what the mouse buttons do, there are
												dozens of
												available clicks (any key on the keyboard), not just three. And, they
												can
												do different things that work together.
												<!-- as mentioned,
									the two hands are working together like operating a real-time machine.-->

																To select an individual object, you press the

							<Br /><Br />
						</li>

						<ul>
							<li>
								<p style="font-size:30px;font-family:sans-serif;font-weight:bold">To drag an object, you
									press
									the spacebar key after the object has been selected (using tab click), and the
									object moves in lock
									step with the cursor. In other words, this is a drag lock, affixing objects to the
									cursor. To release the drag lock, press the spacebar key again
									and the object is dropped where it is. This is called
									"carting" by Redesign.Codes. (It is named as such because a cart moves its contents
									quickly using wheels on the ground whereas dragging something on the ground is very
									sluggish.)</p>

							</li>


							<ul>
								<li>
									<p style="font-size:30px;">To recap: CARTING is pressing a keyboard key (the
										spacebar)
										that locks the underlying object to the cursor's location. Moving the cursor
										then moves
										the object onscreen. Releasing the object happens by pressing the spacebar
										again. Then pick up
										another object, drop it, and so on.</p>
								</li>

								<li>
									<p style="font-size:30px;">The mouse then does one job well, coordination of
										movement of the drag-locked
										objects, while the other hand can do its job well to pick up and drop objects
										(determining when to
										release the object or what else to do with them using other keyboard keys).
									</p>
								</li>

								<li>
									<p style="font-size:30px;">When an object or set of objects is locked to the cursor,
										it is
										in the carting mode, or put differently, it is being carted.

							<!--    
<li><p>First, what is dragging? It is holding down a mouse button move an onscreen object as if it were dragged physically by the mouse.</p>

										stamp, rotate, scale, and more are available. An object can be stamped
										quickly at different angles this way during the carting, just to give one
										example, then dropped back onto the page.
									</p>
								</li>


								<ul>
									<li>
										<p style="font-size:30px;"> In summary, the object is locked to the cursor, the
											mouse moves it around, and other keys like <i>stamp</i> let you stamp it
											wherever
											you want and other keys let you scale it or rotate it as you stamp it. </p>
									</li>

								</ul>

								<!--
					<li>
						<p style="font-size:30px;">
							During either drawing of lines or carting of objects, there are various machine modes available

							that are flipped on or off to configure a physical machine while it is in operation).


						<ul>

							<li>
								<p style="font-size:30px;">
									For example, during carting, if the <i>subtract</i> mode is turned on, each

				<h3>Reducing the Number of Confirmation Dialog Boxes</h3>

				<p>
					For a future operating system, one goal of <i>Redesign.Codes</i> is to make it so that
					there are seldom any dialog boxes prompting for confirmation about what the user just
					instructed the computer to do. It is also a goal to eliminate the use of popovers and warnings
					that inform the user about how an action taken in the software will affect something,
					what a user interface control does, or where something is located.
				</p>

				<p>Generally, the approach involves mirroring how a real-world action does not require
					dialog boxes. For example, when a plate is put
					in the dishwasher from the sink, there are multiple steps: the plate is lifted, the
					dishwasher door is opened, and then the plate is put inside the dishwasher. Finally,
					the dishwasher door is closed.
				</p>

				<p>In a computer, it would be a button that immediately transports the plate from the sink
					to the interior of the dishwasher, which might be too much all at once,
					like how deleting a selected file from the filesystem with one press of <kbd> backspace </kbd> would
					be too drastic.
					The solution provided in the 1980s when the GUI came out was to ask the user if pressing <kbd>
						backspace </kbd> really was
					what he or she wanted, just after the user pressed it.
					On a future operating system provided by <i>Redesign.Codes</i>, there are few such
					dialog boxes. What you do for confirmation is press four different keys on the keyboard:
				</p>
				<!--
				<p>If it were a computer, it would be a device that suddenly transports the plate
					to the interior of the dishwasher with a single button press on your keychain.  
					Then a popup would show in your AR glasses
					asking if you really wanted to instantly put the plate in the dishwasher.
				</p>
			-->

				<!--
				<p>For dealing with files, a middle ground is sought by making multiple steps happen
					on the keyboard.
				</p>-->

				<ul>
					<li>To close a document window without saving the document, activate the
						<kbd> caps lock </kbd>
						and press <kbd> ] </kbd>, <kbd> \ </kbd>, <kbd> ] </kbd>, <kbd> \ </kbd>.
						The application then closes the document window without writing the file to disk.
						<ul>
							<li>This sequence is listed in the application's menu (assuming that there is still a menu
								like today).</li>
						</ul>

						While using a software application,

							<li>Trivial objects can be deleted just by pressing the <kbd> backspace </kbd> key

							<li>

				<p>For a transitional phase, for today's operating systems and software,
					<i>Redesign.Codes</i> suggests the use of a <b>confirm button</b> that,
					when it is key-clicked, requires multiple clicks to activate. Usually, all buttons are clicked
					just one time. If the action's consequences are large, a confirmation dialog box is shown.
					But for a confirm button, in response to receiving multiple clicks, the action
					is just taken right away and there is no dialog box ever shown.
				</p>

				<p>A situation that applies, in Google Chrome if the user attempts to remove an installed extension by
					clicking the
					"remove" button once, Google Chrome asks for confirmation whether the user wants to remove it.
					It could instead use a confirm button.
				</p>

				<ul>
					<li>While hovering over

				<p>
					In a small kind of way, the computer is second-guessing the user when it asks
					whether the unsaved file should be discarded or the trash can should be emptied. The user tries to
					empty the
					trash, but then is asked if he or she wants to empty the trash.
					The goal of these dialog boxes is to prevent glitches from happening, as in the case where the user
					did not really
					mean to empty it but the consequences become something big and drastic.

					<!-- The trash can itself is not the problem,
					but it also is because once it is full the person might worry whether it should
					be emptied after all.-->

				</p>


				<p>Making the user's actions more physical will assist this situation. The <kbd> caps lock </kbd> is a
					very physical key.</p>

				<ul>

					<li>
						To empty the trash, select the trash can symbol once, activate the <kbd> caps lock </kbd>, and
						press the delete key twice.
					</li>
					</li>
				</ul>

				<p>No dialog box has to be shown that asks whether the trash can actually should be emptied.
				</p>

				<p>In some cases, the trash can is not preferred because no intermediate location for the files is
					desired.
					A lot of computer professionals prefer the command line because it deletes right away with the
					<code>rm</code> command.
					But a person has to be careful with that command.
				</p>

				<ul>
					<li>
						To delete a selected file on the system (not put it in the trash can), activate the caps lock,
						then press the delete key three times.
						<ul>
							<li>With each delete key press it turns darker or more red.</li>
						</ul>
					</li>
				</ul>



				<p>This way, no dialog box is needed for that file to be removed from the file system.</p>


				<p>To confirm some action on a website, the following sequence can be provided</p>

				<li>
					Press the return key twice, followed by a single (specified) alphanumeric key.

				<h3>Enhancing the File System, Avoiding Navigating the File System While Saving Files</h3>

				-<p><i>Redesign.Codes</i> also intends to significantly the number of times
					user has to navigate the filesystem as it exists today in its current data tree
					structure. The way it exists never gives the feeling that folders or files can be
					found.</p>

				<p>
					It starts with enhancing the capabilities associated with folders by allowing the
					user to assign them various properties that actually provide other functionality
					afterwards. <i>There also need to be other ways for the user to organize the contents
						of a folder besides just sorting by name, filesize, last modified, etc., and
						this involves setting up rules for some folders so that the operating system
						automatically groups and organizes the contents, even the subdirectories,
						according to what was.
					</i>

				<p> Importantly, "folder" is actually just assigning an office concept to what is a file directory
					data structure. Other names could be assigned to the file directory concept instead.
					But if the name is added to the operating system, the purpose is that container type
					sorts the information or displays it according to what it is (e.g. photo album box).
					So, another step in the process involves changing the name of this file directory from just "folder"
					to a large number of container types that have their own behaviors and viewers.
					They sort and display directory and file contents for the user. If there is
					going to be an AR future, this is the way the computer file system would need to be
					regarded by the operating system.


				<p>
					If a folder on the file system has been tagged with a certain label
					such as "movie project 1", the user can just assign this label
					to a new document in the software application, and when it is saved
					it is automatically placed into that labeled folder, regardless of where
					it is on the file system. That is, there is no save dialog box shown
					if the user has tagged the document with a save label. The operation
					of saving the file just does so immediately and the user can edit
					the filename inside the window.

				<p>
					So if the folder is moved, the files
					that are tagged with this label "movie project 1", inside any software application,
					will be sent to that location on the file system.
				</p>

				<p>The user sets up folders in advance with labels, and by default saving or
					documents takes place by saving to a folder label.</p>

				<p>
					On the filesystem, also there can be different types of folders that
					follow certain rules, sorting the contents automatically according to
					the settings. If an image is saved to a folder of a certain
					rule template, it automatically goes into that folder's
					"images" directory. The same would take place if any image file
					were dragged or moved into the directory. The folders themselves
					can have configured rules, and the operating system can provide
					several templates.
				<ul>
					<li>according to the template rules of a folder,
						a text file (.txt filetype)
						can be automatically moved into a named "text file" directory, but this
						does not always have to be so in the folder.
						a text file tagged with a certain label would be automatically moved into
						a different location.

					</li>
					<li>
						Image files saved to or dropped onto the folder are placed into the "images" directory
						automatically, but inside that directory they are sorted according to filetype, such as PSD,
						jpeg.
					</li>
					<li>Movie length rules can be applied to a "movies" subfolder, with the folder
						sorting out footage files according to length or other properties like location.
					</li>
					<li>For a folder, content filters that actually look inside the files,
						can be set up for certain file types, such as word processing
						documents or PDFs. If a word processing document contains a certain phrase, it will be placed
						into a certain subfolder.
					</li>

				</ul>
				</p>

				<h4>Groupings inside Folders</h4>
				<p>
					On a file system, inside a folder there is only one organizing feature and that is to place
					the items in a subfolder. Inside the folder, if they need to be grouped,
					they are only able to be put in another subdirectory.
					The problem with that is how every grouping of items necessarily
					creates another node on the file tree for the user to navigate, and the overall
					arrangement of this kind of tree structure is unpleasant for the user because it is so bare.

				<p>
					Instead of this, an additional convention that is called
					<i>folder groupings</i> allows files to be grouped inside the same folder
					without making subfolders. They are collected according to criteria, such as
				<ul>
					<li>a grouping tag that the files share</li>
					<li>a preset rule, applied to the folder, that automatically maintains
						a <i>folder grouping</i> (e.g. a certain file type groups the files, a certain naming
						convention to the files groups them).
					</li>
				</ul>

				<p> This way, examining at the contents of a folder can have more happening
					than just files and folders. There are collections of files and they
					sit next to the subfolders. (There can also be groupings
					of folders that do not have any files placed in the collection.)
				</p>

				<!--
					<h4>Providing an available "Purpose" Tag to Folders and Files</h4>

					<ul>

				<h4>Folder Types (Container Types) for Browsing a File System</h4>


				<p>
					Following the environment in which the computers were made,
					the file system is grouped according to "Files" and "folders"
					just like the storage of data in an office.
				</p>

				<p>
					But for its operating system, <i>Redesign.Codes</i> is expects to add a layer
					of data types on top of the common flat directory structure.
					<!-- and it adding something conceptual.-->

				<p>To give an example, a small filing box with grouping tabs is a much better 
					data representation of the files for a directory than the current "folder", 
					because the tabs represent groups of files inside the same directory.  
					By allowing the user to make groups inside the same directory, they can be displayed in 
					tabs in the file-browsing window without having to open up subdirectories.  
					Navigating into yet another subcontaining directory (right now
					a "subfolder") isn't necessary to view more groups of files and folders.
					The groups sit parallel in the same directory.
				</p>

				<p>
					Directories can be setup in the computer filesystem to be presented with names of 
					containers existing in regular life. They can have different data types: bins, drawers, shelves, albums, rooms, and
					buildings.  And when a directory is given programmatic behavior, or a set of rules that it follows, the data
					can be organized like many objects out there, like real filing cabinets or cabinets that have drawers that are filled with 
					plastic boxes.
					
				<p>This is much easier for conceptualizing data. A font goes in the workshop room, in a cabinet, 
					just like real fonts. It isn't a flat directory structure like /System/Fonts/.  That is replaced by
					Computer[COMPLEX]/Workshop[ROOM]/Fonts[CABINET]/.
				</p>
				
				<p>It is possible to make a file setup called warehouse, and then organize all of
					the data according to racks in a warehouse, where each directory type follows a program
					 (warehouse > rack > shelving section > shelf).   Really, "warehouse" is just a file directory,
					 but in the whole of the operating system it displays its contents consistent with
					 what can be placed in it: racks, rack sections, etc.
					 
					 <p>
					 It is also possible to make a file setup called home, garage, etc. The GUI for the filesystem shows these
					directories accordingly.
				</p>

				<p>The same rule-based sorting is available: if you place a movie file in the warehouse,
					it can be the case that it goes to the right rack or set of racks.
					If you put a photograph in a certain room of a house,
					it is placed in the right drawer of a certain chest. By default, if you put it in that room it goes
					to that chest, etc.  
				</p>

				<p>This works for 3D models, as they often can be sorted as physical objects inside
					a conceptual storage space of one type or another.
				</p>



				<!--

					<h4>The Lack of Organizational Functionality of Objects</h4>

					<p>
					</p>

					<p>If there is any main issue it is the lack of differentiation among objects.</p>

					<ul>
						<li>On a video website, there is no allowed ranking of importance of the videos
						that someone uploads. All videos uploaded are of the same category as well.
						There actually aren't even categories, just "playlists".
							Uploaders may upload videos of different types, length, and purposes.
							 An extreme is then taken and a different catalog is made of extremely
							 short videos.
						</li>
					</ul>

					-->



				<!--
						<p>

							As it is displayed in the OS, the grouping 
					files could be grouped inside
					a folder without placing them into another one.
				</p>-->


				<!--
				<p>With the key-click UI, confirmation of an action can take place by having
					the user type "j","k","l" when the cursor is placed over a confirmation control.
				</p>
				-->

				<!--
					<p>Eventually, <i>Redesign.Codes</i> would put a non-button type of control
					on the keyboard for confirmation of user commands. It might need to be moved up
					multiple notches, from the bottom to the top.
				</p>-->

				<!--
				<i>Redesign.Codes</i> recommends
				<ul>
					<li>reducing the number of command shortcuts that require a modifier key (control, shift, alt)</li>
					<li>reducing the number of dialog boxes that ask for confirmation</li>
				</ul>

				<p>It's simple just to say these two things, but actually this comes about
					as a result of changing the whole of the computer interaction.
				</p>

				<p>A lot of user interface conventions like shortcuts that require multiple
					keys and the dialog box are leftover from the 1980s, when the programmers
					involved just made the first draft of what a GUI would be for
					computers.  The standard was a little bit lower, because
					any interactive computer graphics were considered something big for
					computers.				
				</p>

				<ul>
					<li>

					Generally speaking, it is best not to have hard refreshes of
					the screen, like dialog boxes that show up unexpectedly
					and interrupt what is happening.  The user is somewhat of
					a captive to the screen.  People used the computer a lot less
					in the 1980s.
				</li>

				<li>Keyboard shortcuts are fatiguing.</li>
				</ul>

					<p>When web pages transition from
					one to another, it would be better, for example, if the
					link expanded into the full view of the browser,
					as if the user were entering the page.  Just jumping from
					one flat screen to the next is harsh.  Any flat
					refresh of the screen is harsh.  Likewise, so is the sudden
					appearance of notifications and dialog boxes that ask for
					confirmation.
				</p>

				<p>If an action taken is supposed to have permanent or dramatic
					consequences, the solution at the moment is to ask with
					dialog boxes, or even make the user enter a password 
					to confirm.
				</p>
			-->
				<!--<p><i>Redesign.Codes</i> recommends other
					ways to handle the situation:</p>
					<p>
				The best way to avoid dialog boxes is to make the action
				just like the real world, where it is committal and the computer does not
				need to ask any questions about whether the next step should be taken
				that was just attempted.
				
					
				<p>
					The more serious the outcome, the more dramatic the requirement can be.
				</p>
			-->


				<!--
				<p>The concern lately is that a person will just press the return key
					without really looking at what the dialog box said.  
					In these cases, the return key does not
					stand in for clicking the "OK" button.
				</p>

				<p><i>Redesign.Codes</i> recommends that dialog boxes
				be replaced with another UI technique. 
				In particular those that ask for confirmation.</p>

				<h2 id="adoptingMarkupUnderneathTheCode">Adopting Markup Underneath The Code Files</h2>


				<!-- <h3>Code Is Not Yet Rendered According to Markup, It is Displayed as Characters</h3>-->

				<h3>There Is No Markup inside a Code File
					<!--., But The Technical Obstacles Are Not Large for Doing That-->
				</h3>

				<!--
		<p>
			As all programmers know, it's just a long list of bytes that make up a plain text
			file and then the computer (code editor) displays them as individual characters.
			It's a 1:1 correspondence.  It's not markup, meaning that no graphics
			will be displayed as a result of what is in the plain text file.
		-->
				<p>
					At the current time, computer code is not rendered according to any markup,
					and this applies to basically any programming language. The code is just
					listed out line by line inside the code editor as the plain text characters it is.
					<i>Redesign.Codes</i> is working to supply an alternative to this, such that code
					editors render their code files (inside the code viewer area) according to the files' underlying
					markup.
					For <i>Redesign.Codes</i>, XML is the chosen file format because it is already 
					the foundation of many file specifications that
					have done relevant work in different areas. 
					<!-- How to make a data table in XML
					has already been worked out in an Excel document (.xslx), 
					for example, and it is relatively simple to re-implement specifications 
					made for XML.-->

					<!--(which has graphics expertise in it because it
		stemmed from Adobe's proposed file format, 
		<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Precision_Graphics_Markup_Language">PGML</a>-->
					<!--
		but was not given a full feature specification by the W3C, causing trouble for the
		graphic design software community-->

		<p>
			Anything in a code file today could have its contents wrapped in a markup format,
			from loops to conditional expressions. The file could sit on the hard drive as XML and then be
			rendered in
			the code editor, thereby providing a great deal of graphical differentiation between
			its elements. Many opportunities for advancing code as a whole emerge.

		<p>
			There really is no reason to avoid converting programming language code files to XML or
			another markup format.
			<!-- It could be done right away, and Redesign.Codes even
	asked Apple to do it. -->

			That's because with a rendered result the code can be made to show up any way
			desired. A code editor can even take a file's markup and render the code
			exactly the same as it looks today-- if that were ever wanted (though it probably won't be often).

		<p>
			There are a lot of code editors out there these days, but none actually deal with rendering XML for
			code itself.
			After this change is made, you could display and edit code any way you want, and the constant need
			to
			maintain indentations, a vestige of the computer terminal past,
			could be left behind for the first time. It's important to start removing the invisible nuisances
			such as the manual maintainenance of text indentations, and markup is the first
			step to take. It expands what a code file can provide in many areas.

				<p>Typewritten code has never had its own XML file format,
					but when that begins to happen, code files can be treated  as
					documents instead of many pieces of plain text sitting 
					on the file system that have to be gathered during the build phase
					of an app.<!-- there are already many other formats to look at for reference.-->
					In the future, for example, it will be possible to set an object variable equal to an interactive
					data table. Previously, that same data would sit in a separate file, even if it were short (often
					in raw XML, actually).

					<p>
					Long files of tabular data can only be referenced by name inside a line of 
					computer code today, and no portion is ever displayed inside the files.
					But when code is in the form of a document, and it includes interactive elements like
						data tables, the code itself can interact with what those elements contain:
					if the table contains rows of objects, a line can be drawn from a certain cell to 
					a line of code.  		(Usually interacting with data tables is slow because
					of clicking with the mouse, so the section above on
					key-click UI discusses speedy approaches to interacting with the data table).
					
					<p>Embedding data tables inside files of code, 
						is already taking computer programming into a different area,
					but the issue is not one of abstraction because all of this can be
					converted to the existing low-level programming languages of today.
					Adding markup provides opportunities for adding a layer of layout, organization,
					interactivity and, importantly, consolidation of components into a document.

					<p>Markup allows:</p>
						<ul>
							<li>Inclusion of non-code elements next to the code.</li>
							<li>Multiple columns.
								<ul><li>This allows placing the non-code elements adjacent
									to the lines of code.
								</li></ul>
							</li>
						</ul>

						<p>
							This is already	a huge shift from 
							how computer programming looks and acts today.
							Already, the discussion about what
							code should be has changed. But the underlying compiler technology provided
							by computer scientists and software engineers is not impacted.  (As
							the computer systems become accustomed to the upgrades, they can be modifed
							later.)
						</p>

					<!-- more of an interactive document than a mere text of characters. -->
					
				<p>
					For making code resemble documents, XML syntax is already established in different areas.
					The table below (which could actually sit in a document of code someday as it appears),
					exhibits how different uses of XML have generated custom specifications,
					and if a code file existed that made use of XML it could combine many features from several
					of these formats. There is nothing holding code back from incorporating 3D models
					in the rendered documents, as the markup allows sophisticated, multicolumn layouts.
					Apprehension from the computer programming community has come from the perception that
					this would be too slow to interact with for practical purposes or that it
					would not be able to accommodate complexity found in code.  It's actually the opposite,
					because code become capable of expressing much more complex scenarios when
					lines can be drawn from non-code elements to the lines of computer code.

					For computer code, the XML structure would have to be something of its own

				<h3>Markup Enables Interactivity inside Code </h3>

				</p>
				<p>
					When there is markup inside the code file, and the
					code editor acts as a graphical processor of that markup, there is the ability to add
					interactivity. You will be able to set an array variable equal
					to an interactive data table or list. What is future computer programming?
					You will be able to define interactive controls for any type of object variable that you make
					in your code: if you make an animation curve object class, you will be able to
					tell the code editor that you want to edit all such objects with curve interactive controls.
					As long as the key-click UI is implemented, interacting with controls inside a code
					file will not be a problem. Every time an animation curve appears in your code, you will be able to
					edit it according to what
					you want, probably an editable graph with a popup button list of different curves you can load.
					<!-- like in
		a software application, but inside the code.-->

				<p>For the programming topic of a data list,
					we made it fast for you below because, after hovering over a field, you can just start typing over
					what is there. It is a demonstration of how a GUI can be integrated into computer code without
					causing trouble for the professional coder. Once this type of example is extended,
					powerful conventions that look good in a diagram but never translated well to computer code,
					such as a set of workflows and states, will actually be able to be utilized in code files for
					the first time, but without being out of place.

				<h3>Markup Inside a Code File Informs the Code Editor</h3>

				<p>Also, if you typed out a variable and it didn't exist,
					the code editor would know right away because of parsing the XML.
					If our code had markup underneath it wouldn't have to allow any syntax errors
					or any typos before code compilation. Your code could compile nearly 100% of the time.
					That's because anywhere the text cursor were deposited inside the text, the code editor would know
					what is allowed (based on its existing trees that describe the programming language's syntax). And
					if the
					text cursor left the location without depositing valid code, the code editor could just
					ignore what was entered.
					<!--(or, in some cases, not let the text cursor leave the area of the document
		until something valid were provided).-->
				</p>

				<p>It is the possibility of integrating non-code aspects of the software (e.g.
					images, curves, 3d models)
					within the code document that should take computer code to an advanced level.
					Not only will the underlying XML allow for the addition of these elements
					inside code, but it will allow for multi-column layouts found in a magazine
					or other print publication.
				</p>


				On the code layout side of modernizing computer code, here are four
				important components to start with:

				<ul>
					<li>Markup Inside The Code File Format</li>
					<li>Implementation of Page Layout by the Code Editor (Multicolumn)</li>
					<li>Interface Controls for Objects (e.g. Data Tables Like The Example Above)</li>
					<li>Brisk Mouse + Keyboard Interactivity with the Code Elements (Going Beyond Just Typing)</li>
					</ol>


					On the graphic design side of revamping computer code, here are
					some additions:
					<ol>
						<li>
							Every variable displays a small symbol of its data type next to it, and all object
							classes are provided symbols automatically if they were not provided by the programmer in
							advance.
							For example, a bezier path will have a pen symbol next to it, a rectangle struct will have a
							dotted rectangle next to it:
							<br /><br />

							<span style="font-family: monospace;margin-left:30px;">
								<span class="symbolForDataType"><img src="img/bezierPathPortSymbol.png"
										width="25" style="margin-bottom:-3px;">
									rectangleBezierPath</span>.appendRect(<span class="symbolForDataType"><span
										style="font-size:30px;">⬚</span>
									rect</span>)<span style="color:red;padding-left:4px;padding-right:4px;">;</span>
							</span>
						</li>

						<li>
							Every container made with curly braces is replaced with an outlined box, and the GUI
							interactivity
							makes this as fast as removing or replacing curly braces.
						</li>

						<li>
							When there are indentations, they are made graphically distinct. An example using
							curly braces is below. Each nesting level gets slightly darker.

					<h3>Writing a Line of Code Next to an Image or 3D Model Will Require Implementing Magazine-Style
						Layouts</h3>


					<p>When making an app, the programmer places any media "assets" (images, 3d models, sound files,
						etc.)
						into separate file directories. The media files are totally separated from the code files that
						make use of them.
						That is to say, an image file will only be viewed by the programmer if he goes out
						of his way to navigate to it inside the IDE, interrupting the rest of his programming.
						This leads to heavier reliance on multiple computer displays, to open up windows and multiple
						frames inside windows. It also requires frequent interaction with the IDE interface so that
						anything referenced on a line of code can also be inspected.

					<p>What the programmer should really want is the ability to write code
						that sits alongside, above, or below the image assets, laid out magazine-style.
						A magazine-style layout of code also allows for programmatically tapping
						into the various properties that the media files carry, using connector lilnes,
						making use of them as variables or objects inside the code.

					<p>For example, it would be far superior to interact with an animation curve graph <i>inside</i>
						a code file, as an interactive element compared to typing out all of the code needed to make a
						specific, predefined curve. And if the IDE or system provides this stock, interactive utility it
						will be used by all programmers for all sorts of purposes.

					<p>Utility elements such as graphs can be inserted into code, but the file format for programming
						has to change to one that embodies markup.

					<p>Comments will be able to sit to the right or the left of code. They will also be able to be
						hidden.
						Annotations do not have to be
						limited to plain text but can also include diagrams, blueprints (or even animations).

						Markup will let comment blocks and comments serve different purposes.
						After all, comments, section headers, documentation, and making inactive a line or
						area of code are all separate topics.</p>

					<ul>
						<li>
							The key-click UI allows pressing keys while hovering the cursor over sections of code to
							<ul>
								<li>make one area inactive for compilation (using a key-click key), the
									equivalent of "commenting out" a line of code.
								</li>
								<li>make a group of code sections inactive (using a key-click key that activates a
									rectangle-select mode)</li>
								<li>annotate them (one key-click, followed by the appearance of an ajacent text box,
									following by hover-entry of text)</li>
								<li></li>
							</ul>
						</li>
					</ul>

					<p>When programming languages were first produced, computers did not display bitmap images or
						interactive media except in special research project circumstances. Today, though, this is a
						main part of what people use the computer for, and programmers are often programming something
						that intersects with graphics, at least the components that make up an application's GUI.
						The form of code that programmers use today, as a whole, does not reflect what they are
						engineering it to do.
					<p>
						<!--This is just one limitation of many brought by the current, primitive state of code.-->
						<!--  An IDE is arbitrarily set up to separate code from media assets, and it could take up any organizational scheme assigned to it.  But before that can happen, the file format of code has to be upgraded.-->


					<h3>Editing Code Interactively in AR/VR Is Made Closer to Viable as a Work Activity When Code Uses
						Markup Underneath</h3>

					<p>Because of the markup being provided, 3D programmers will have better parsing handles on the code
						that is shown in a code editor on a desktop computer.  It will be easy
						to take the code and pop it out into 3D.  Since it is in XML, it can be made to
					manifest in any way in a 3D scene.  All of the implementation attributes of a looping statement,
				for example, are provided inside the markup, 
				so the resulting interactive, 3D model is up to the 3D programmers.</p>

					<h3>Two Steps to Upgrading Computer Code</h3>

					<p>
						There are two initial steps to upgrading today's computer code, to set programming on a more
						advanced technological course.
					<p>
						The first step is to replace the plain text format with markup so as to add structure and
						hierarchy to code files,
						which will then enable a broad range of features inside programming languages. The second step
						is to decide how the user interface will exist once the programming language adopts new
						functionality
						enabled by markup.
						The section above discussed the key-UI.
						<!--, whether it will stay close to current programming interactivity or establishing something entirely divergent.  -->
						For example, if there is rich text or mathematical notation, what interactive convention does
						the IDE	use for insertion or editing of the text?
						The window for editing a code file likely will end up taking on the appearance page layout program,
						but it must match the speed of interaction programmers currently have with plain text code.
						That is the top priority after implementing markup.
						Interface slowdown has prevented code from upgrading to a more graphical form.
						If the mouse is to be utilized in a new interactive scheme for programming,
						it should not be done until a demo'ed scheme matches current interface speeds, and this is
						achieved with the key-click UI. 
						
						<p>Generally speaking, the mouse has to be regarded
						differently from how it has conventionally been used,
						in the following way:
						</p>
						
						<ul>
						<li>It does not simulate dragging anything, as if the object is underneath the mouse
							and pressed down by the button.
							</li>
							<li>
							It doesn't simulate pressing down on anything as if the object is underneath
							the mouse and pressed down by the button.</li>
							<li>It just informs the computer about the location of the cursor so
								that the keyboard keys can take the actions.</li>
							<!--<li>It is not an interface for simulating actions of a person's hand inside the computer screen.</li>-->
					</ul>
 
						<!-- which is a user-friendly way to ensure that all
						computer users everywhere can do anything.-->
						Keeping programming keyboard-driven, including during the use of the mouse, will ensure that
						interface slowdown does
						not happen.
					<p>
						Another avenue involves providing the programmer specialized programming peripherals,
						with multiple sliders and macro keys, but these might have to be carried inside laptop bags.
						For future computer programming systems, this might be the way to go because it allows
						custom keys with custom dimensions to match the IDE. But at first, the world of computer
						programming should become familiar with markup modifying what is considered "code".

					<h4>The Benefits of Markup Will Be Numerous</h4>
					<p>
						Markup will allow the incorporation of many modern computing
						features into code, such as page layout, rich text,
						mathematical notation, geometric figures, graphing of equations,
						hyperlinks, images, and data tables.
						With markup, connector lines can be drawn between
						elements inside a mostly text code file, for
						whatever programmatic purpose that is needed,
						and this points to how a new landscape is opened up in
						terms of capability.
						<!--But none of these new features can be added to existing code haphazardly.-->

					<p>
						There are various issues that programming languages
						have struggled with that cease to be relevant because they were
						actually a consequence of the plain text file format, not an inherent
						phenomenon of writing code for an electronic machine.
						For example, plain text computer code has always struggled with
						the issue of function arguments and their labels.
						If parameter labels are present, the code seems too verbose.
						But if they are not there, the code doesn't provide enough
						information about the function when reviewing the code.
						This problem does not exist any longer when
						code is converted to markup underneath. The labels for the
						function parameters just sit directly above the values, in superscript.
						It's a layout capability inherently available when having markup
						and modern computer screens.

						Data types for any variable or any function signature can just
						sit in superscript, eliminating the confusion that has been
						present for a long time since.

						<!--						Plain text does not allow this kind of thing, of course,
						but it is natural and automatically available when the
						code is made of markup inside the files.
-->
					<p>What is important to note is that when features are available
						naturally with markup, they are easily provided. But
						when code editors are always analyzing lines of plain text,
						those same features would never be inserted into what is shown
						to the programmer. The markup suggests avenues at the
						same time as
					<ul>
						<li>
							makes it easier programmatically for the writers
							of code editors.
						</li>
					</ul>
					</p>

					<p>Currently what is happening is the code editor is taking
						a file of plain text and trying to analyze what it contains
						or what the programmer would possibly be trying to put into
						it with the keyboard. But when programming languages are
						actually made of markup, the surrounding code editor looks
						like a page layout program with all kinds of premade widgets
						and tools. The dynamic of programming changes.
					</p>

					<p>The user interface for editing plain text is straightforward,
						as there are no complexities, just characters in sequence.
						By comparison, the interface editing rich text is not straightforward,
						and <i>Redesign.Codes</i> regards the inconsistencies in interaction
						with it as a reason programmers are averse to upgrading code to
						a more graphical form. There is always, currently but not innately, some
						kind of frustrating glitch that occurs while editing rich text because inside
						the rich text are actually markers for each character with styling information
						and the roaming text editing cursor has not been set up accurately to edit them.
						All users have had the experience of being in an area of text that is bold when
						it should not have been, dealt with a seemingly stubborn area that won't move over to the
						desired
						styling. Since this annoyance never happens in plain text, programmers across the world are
						often eager to keep programming in plain text.</p>

					<!--a line of code
			can have subdivisions: each
			function parameter can have the label in a two row
			setup, where the parameter named sits above
			the value passed to the function.-->

					</p>

					<!--		<p>
			What happens when the console logging command is actually
			in graphical form? Then the debugger output will allow loggin
			4
		</p>
	-->

					<!--
		<p> If any of these components
		are added to the code file, such as an image, they can be
		used throughout it.  A line of computer code can reference column A, row 2 of a data table placed inside its code file.  -->


					<p>
						There isn't a mainstream programming language
						that couldn't be converted to a markup format underneath, but then new
						dilemmas will appear: with the new features enabled by
						markup there will be consequent user interface needs.

					<p>

						How code is displayed in a version control (e.g. git) repository
						web page will have to be accommodated, but this also should not
						be too difficult to handle given that it is markup being added,
						and all web pages are made out of markup.
						For some people, the terminal shell will also
						need the capability of displaying the marked-up code files-- but this is
						also an upgrade that is long overdue anyway.
						There is no real reason that shells should
						remain in plain text, as there isn't a computer manufactured today
						that is technologically limited to that, as was the case in the early 1990s.
						This points to another topic not covered on this edition of <i>Redesign.Codes</i>,
						which is that the conventional terminal shell can be rewritten
						to accommodate graphics, the key-click UI, and this would take place through a provided
						SDK.


						<!--
		<p>
		But once new modern features are enabled through
		the adoption of markup, there are opportunities
		to add interactive features, which will make the issue
		of user interface come up immediately.   There are many
		paths to go down: the user interface could be 
		kept the same as plain text.
		
		<p>
		But what those new modern features will be depends
		on the choices made by the organization that
		implements them, with there being an enormous
		range of outcomes.

	<h2>Additional Issues for Computing</h2>

	<h3>Providing Programming Systems, Not Merely Programming Languages</h3>

	<!--
	<p>If there is a consistent pattern of behavior in computer software
		development that needs addressing it is</p>

		<ul>
			<li>leaving you unprepared.			</li>
			<li>requiring too many steps that should be automated.</li>
			
		</ul>
	-->

	<p>A programming language provides nothing beyond the syntax and 
		functionality of the bare, plain-text language. 
		Anything needed, even if it is relatively basic, has to be sought out 
		and included secondarily, outside of the programming language itself.

		<ul>
			<li>The programming language will not acknowledge what is
				added outside of its own syntax and functionality, such as
				a set of workflows or a state machine.  If those two
				data types are incorporated, they will be accessed
				making a second layer on top of the programming language's existing
				features. 
			</li>
			<li>The programming language does not acknowledge
				needs that are satisfied by curve controls or other types of
				interactive elements.  What is imported as "libraries"
				will still be made use of and accessed with plain text code,
				no matter the subject's relevance to interactive controls.
			</li>

			<li>Building blocks are fixed: whatever is included in
				the programming language is what will be there.
			</li>
		</ul>
	</p>

	<p>
		A programming system, by contrast, provides numerous building blocks,
		including components known to the profession of computer science, like
		an R-Tree and a collection of other data structures. 
		What these building blocks do is recognized inside the code itself,
		not regarded as more flat, plain text "imports".  Such imported
		units can describe how they want to be treated and shown inside the code as well.
		A full system for programming anticipates generally what people do while programming,
		and it takes into account the wide range of activities that programmers are
		involved in while on assignment.  It can have, for example, versioning control
		built into the conventions of the code document.  They are documents
		for a programming system.  They are plain files for a programming language.
		
	</p>

	<p>The mindset of the programming community is one oriented
		entirely toward programming languages.
	</p>

	<p>The reason programming systems are preferable is that
		when those additional building blocks
		are provided, the programming aspects of the system are able to change in response to
		their inclusion into the code.  The system's programming "language" then incorporates
		code editor features that are tailored to the building blocks.  The entirely
		of the programming system is built up and it becomes
		something altogether different and remote from how people regard
		computer programming today.
	</p>

	<p>In a programming language anything beyond basic
		data types like strings, array, integers, and real numbers
		has to be sought out.  If something is not available, like a Voronoi
		function, that means that some web searches need to be done. 
		Not only that, but the chosen library has to be evaluated 
		to see if it is operable and is also adequate. 
		Finally, the specifics of how it is made use of are not going to be 
		consistent from library to library.
		
		<p>
		If, on the other hand, the functionality it fits into the big interactive planning of 
		a programming <i>system</i>, the functionality is consistently accessed and made use of
		similar to other aspects of the system. A programmer can jump 
		into an app right away with access to a wide range of functional
		utilities that are actually used quite frequently in industry.<!--  Put differently, there won't be any
		time to investigate a Voronoi function if it isn't there for
		the programmer.  And if it isn't there, it won't be there
		without a lot of labor on the part of the programmer.-->
	</p>

	<p>So, the concept of "a programming language" is too limited for modern
		computing,	as placing programming into a systematic form changes
		what the whole of it can exist as.  This is possible when the files
		are made of markup.  Converting existing programming languages to
		markup documents, at least as the starting move, 
		ensures that the journey toward modernization of
		code is compatible with how professionals work today.
	</p>

	<p>Not only programming "libraries" that include basic building blocks of
		programming can be provided, but also basic building blocks of
		everyday life, like data types that reflect business activity:
		inventory, invoicing, payments, etc., allowing custom solutions
		in many areas.
	</p>

		<ul>
			<li>Building blocks for programming: programming libraries for data
				structures, functions, equations.
			</li>

			<li>Building blocks for everyday life: programming libraries for
				inventory, invoicing, payments, etc.
			</li>

		</ul>

<h3>What Are Loops Used For Should Be Examined</h3>

<p>In a programming system in the future that recognizes
	what computers are being used for, loops would
	not all be reduced to <code>for</code>, <code>while</code>.
	Related operations would extend beyond <code>map</code> and
	<code>filter</code>.
</p>

<p>Loops are being used for many purposes and these could
	exist natively as commands carrying the a separate set of 
	names.  In other words, there might be dozens of 
named loops in the future and using loops will be much easier overall.</p>

<ul>
<li>replication
	<ul><li>e.g. of graphical objects.</li></ul>

</li>
<li>copying of data.</li>
<li>traversal of a list
	<ul>
		<li>operating on each item in that list.</li>
		<li>applying logic on each item as it shows up.</li>
	</ul>	


</li>
<li>inspection of a list
	<ul>
		<li>is each item matching certain criteria</li>
	</ul>

</li>
<li>culling</li>
<li>assembly of an onscreen representation of data.</li>
<li>sorting (filter)</li>
<li></li>
</ul>


<p>
In a programming system where the onscreen code
is produced from markup residing in the document, 
multiple loops can be shown in parallel, sitting next to each
other in the same row.  Since it is not plain text,
they can sit next to each other.  They then have the ability to
be connected.   Advanced types of loops, and groupings of them, that have not been available
in code can be provided.  Furthermore, they can be programmed
to interact with one another.  A loop can exist as a kind of object
in this programming system.

</p>

	

	<h3>A Third Computer Format: Document Translation Hubs</h3>

	<p>Computer disks store, conceptually
		two things: files and programs.
		Then when the situation becomes
		more closer to the the GUI,
		it becomes applications and documents.
	</p>

	<p>The user has to deal with file types
		constantly, such as which application
		to use to open the file and how to
		convert to another.
		Conversion between file types is a regular 
		concern of users that the
		operating system generally does not touch.
	</p>

	<p>Most document types can be categorized
		into different common categories, like
		word processing document.  If these
		categories are established, they can
		then be called, on the file system,
		hubs.  They are like rosetta stones
		for file or document categories.
	</p>

	<p>Of course, converting between formats
		is not always about drag and drop,
		but when there is a central location
		for any given document category
		that has the tools to convert,
		then if a new format is added it just
		needs to be put into the translation
		hub.
	</p>

	<!--
	<p>The relationship between applications
		and documents was investigated
		in 1995 at one computer company,
		where the documents themselves stored
		information about the applications.
	</p>-->

	<h3>Loading application binaries</h3>

	<p>Why is it that software all has
		a period of launch when some
		applications are small and don't
		need much in terms of launch resources?	
		Many apps, like calendar apps, don't need
		to be compiled with today's computers.
	</p>

	<p>If the operating system provides
		the stock utilities, the programs
		most people use today could actually
		be made with 
	</p>

	<h3>All-around "two-way binding", in the physical and digital</h3>
	
	<p>"Two-way binding" describes keeping in sync the values
		of a variable with its associated GUI control.
	</p>

		<p>
		This applies also to the real world.  QR codes came
		about because of the need to keep in sync the digital
		and the physical at automobile factories of a
		Japanese manufacturer.  Unlike a barcode, they contain more
		data than a dozen numbers, which is a concrete manifestation
		of computer data in the real world.

		<p>
		The physical and the digital are difficult to keep in sync.
		What was supposed to eliminate paperwork, the electronic medium,
		then demanded paper copies.  When paperwork is made without the computer,
		or produced by a computer printout, it is not always digitized.
</p>

	<p>Even within the digital environment, many components are not
		in sync: receipts are not available in online banking debits
		on the credit cards that produced them.
		Many systems are not working with one another.
	</p>

	<ul>
		<li>Electronic payments and accounting.</li>
		<li>Physical invoices and digital ones.
			<ul>
				<li>Customers expect invoices to be handed to
					them at a worksite or job.
				</li>
				<li>The general public does not make digital invoices
					onsite.
				</li>
				<li>
					Even if an invoice is handwritten on an e-Ink
					display, it still has to be printed out for the customer.
				</li>
				<li>In a digital environment, checks are still the norm
					because of banking complexities and regulations.</li>
			</ul>

		</li>
		
	</ul>

<h3>The Big Dump of E-mails</h3>

<p>Communication is not all of one purpose, but
e-mail treats all messages exactly the same.
</p>

<p>The main way to eliminate the confusion of an e-mail inbox
	is to make senders classify their e-mail in advance
	if they are anything other than interpersonal correspondence
	from one person to another.

	<p>
		Solitications, notices, recruitment offers, 
		promos, etc. all have to identify themselves in advance
		as such under the right category.  What
		does not require prior self-classification is
		regular interpersonal communication, 
		for business and person uses.  
	</p>
	
	<p> General e-mail correspondence from one person to another 
	is labeled as "general" and passes into the inbox. 
	But any other communication would have to classify itself
	in advance.  There are three categories for e-mail:

	<ul>
		<li>Person-to-person / Person-to-informal-small-group</li>
		<li>Individual or entity to bulk recipients (e.g. promos)</li>
		<li>Entity to person

			<ul>
				<li>Purchase receipts</li>
				<li>Shipping notices</li>
				<li>Account recovery</li>
				<li>Monthly bills</li>
				<li>Mailing list (actual opt-in)</li>
				<li>Legal notices and user agreement updates</li>
				<li>Coupons, offers, promos, sales.</li>
			</ul>
		</li>
	</ul>

	<p>It is beneficial to all that a bill declares itself
		as such.
	</p>
	
	<p>These are all categories that should be sorted
		before they ever enter the inbox.
	</p>



	<p>The three bigger categories already sort most e-mail.</p>
	If an e-mail misclassifies itself on purpose,
	this is much easier to correct.  Many e-mails sent
	out are self-interested or offer no value
	to the recipients, such as notices of changes to 
	company policies.


	<p>What are the intentions of the individual e-mail?
	This might also be provided by the sender in advance.

	<p>Categories of intentions for two people include:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Business</li>
		<li>Cold e-mail for sales</li>
		<li>Job Offer / Recruitment</li>
	</ul>
