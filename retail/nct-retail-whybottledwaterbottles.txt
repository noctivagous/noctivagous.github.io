Why Bottled Water Bottles

   - opening of the bottle is smaller than
   the person's mouth, unlike a glass or mug's opening.
    - liquid won't overflow around the person's mouth 
   like the mouth of a glass if there is a bump or movement.
    - requires less active coordination than a glass, cup, or mug.
  
    
- closer to spill-proof
    - if it falls on the floor, less liquid falls out
    because of small opening at top. 
    When the container is picked up after a fall, the spill stops
    whereas a glass or mug spill is usually majority loss of liquid.
    - there is a cap for the bottle that is quickly
    screwed on.   if it is put on ,the liquid loss from a fall
    can be nothing or minimal.
    - even with the cap off, during transport across a room
    the likelihood of some spillage is much lower
    
- very portable container because of cap
    - can be carried down the street, even tossed.
    - lightweight container
