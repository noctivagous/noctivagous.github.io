<h1>The Key-Click UI</h1>
<p>The key-click UI is an improved software user interface for the desktop computer.  

<br><br>A software program that implements the key-click UI treats the keys 
on a keyboard as click buttons.  The mouse buttons are entirely ignored.
Although this can be explained, before reading further, please try out the vector-drawing demo below.

<p>
The concept is that&mdash; and real-world use of the key-click UI has shown&mdash;
there is currently too much work assigned to an individual hand.  
Compared to the key-click UI, the hand is currently burdened. 
It has to do two things at once: coordinate the position of the cursor <i>and</i> click the buttons with the index finger.
In a vector-drawing program, especially, this is excessive; the
unmodified, all-purpose mouse is supposed to drive a
drawing machine setup.  It's actually that the mouse shouldn't be used
for drawing vectors without modifying the interface.


<!--
<p>The key-click UI is not in contradiction with the history of the mouse, as Douglas Engelbart's
  1968 demo of the mouse in fact also featured a .  During the demo, to the left of his keyboard
  he was using a five-key device in tandem with the mouse, which also had click buttons.  
  That five-key device did not make it into personal computers but its essence is the same as the key-click UI.
 </p>
-->



 <p>Separating the click from the mouse divides the labor of
  manipulating the cursor, to two hands instead of one. This leads to a leap in possible dexterity.
  Each hand has been given its own role.  The mouse hand just moves the cursor and
  the clicking hand just clicks with keys.  This opens up a totally different interactive 
  dynamic with the desktop computer, because previously there was never such alternation occuring between
  two hands (move, click, move, click).

    Move the cursor into the gray area.
    Press the <kbd>F</kbd> key to deposit a point.
 <br/>  Then move the mouse.  <br/>
  Press the <kbd>F</kbd> key
  again to deposit another point.

  Repeat until
  it is desired to press an end key (<kbd>A</kbd>,<kbd>E</kbd>,<kbd>R</kbd>).

<h1>Implementing Drag and Drop in The Key-Click UI</h1>

<p>

  The following is not yet available in the web demo above but can be in the future:

  <p>

  To select an individual object, you press the
  <kbd>tab</kbd> key, and it is selected immediately
  as if you had pressed <kbd>shift</kbd>+<kbd>left mouse button</kbd>. The

  <kbd>tab</kbd> key
  selects and de-selects. It is the <i>selection
    click</i>).

  <p>Though any key could be used for this,  <kbd>tab</kbd>
  is chosen because of its location on the keyboard.
It has been paired with <kbd>spacebar</kbd> to move
objects around on the screen.</p>

  <p>
  To drag an object, you press
  the <kbd>spacebar</kbd> key after the object has been selected (using <kbd>tab</kbd> click), and the
  object moves in lock   step with the cursor. In other words, this is a drag lock, affixing objects to the
  cursor. To release the drag lock, press the <kbd>spacebar</kbd> key again
  and the object is dropped where it is. This is called
  "carting" by Noctivagous. It is named as such because a cart moves its contents
  briskly using wheels on the ground whereas dragging something on the ground has lots of friction.
  That is what using carting is like.  It can also be called a drag lock, however.
