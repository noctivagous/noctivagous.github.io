class="c65 doc-content"><p class="c22 c77 title" id="h.q877oc2xj84"><span>Entering Ancient Chinese Science </span></p><p class="c9"><span class="c73 c82">Noctivagous</span></p><p class="c9 c4"><span class="c2"></span></p><h1 class="c1 c22" id="h.kqd6bq3yi9n"><span class="c45 c28">The Five Elements and Yin and Yang</span></h1><h2 class="c1 c22" id="h.ervsfhqb3uup"><span class="c8">Yin and Yang </span></h2><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Yin and yang are considered the two primal elements that&mdash; through their interactions&mdash; give rise to all manifestations in the universe. &nbsp;Their existence spans the celestial bodies, the natural world, human affairs, and even the human body. &nbsp;They represent the two fundamental aspects of what is experienced as &ldquo;reality.&rdquo;. &nbsp;Yin and Yang are opposing and this is the most prominent aspect. &nbsp;But they are also complementary which means each one&rsquo;s opposing qualities bring the other element into completion. &nbsp;Important for us to know from the start as moderns is exactly what the two opposing qualities are, as they often do not line up with our preconceptions and logic. &nbsp;If we can&rsquo;t quite grasp Yin and Yang it will be harder to grasp other theories from ancient China. &nbsp;Secondly, we should also know that the theory&rsquo;s presence does not stop at the discussion of this duality. &nbsp;That is one common misconception. &nbsp;Other, more macroscopic theories in ancient Chinese science place Yin and Yang into larger components for explaining the world. &nbsp;This allows viewing phenomena from myriad angles and the resulting understanding is much deeper than what is known as science today. The ancient Chinese emphasis is often on processes, states of changes, and cycles while also applying these to a wide range of phenomena. &nbsp;Because it is so inclusive of everything and broad, its understanding is more valuable and complete.</span></p><p class="c1"><span>Yang exists as the active, firm, strong, bright element and contributes this aspect to any condition. &nbsp;Yin exists as the yielding, receiving, passive, weak, dark element and </span><span>contributes this</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;aspect. Their existence is interdependent because strength and activity is always present if there is yielding and passivity. &nbsp;It is just that they will interact in a spectrum of proportions that produces a wide range of states. &nbsp;When the firm, active force of Yang and the yielding, passive force of Yin are in conflict&ndash; such as when Yin attempts to overpower Yang&ndash; there is disorder. &nbsp;When they are in balance there is harmony. &nbsp;They exist in many different combinations, always undergoing processes of transformation to greater or lesser degrees, as explained by the Book of Changes, an ancient Chinese divination text that carries broad applications for a person to evaluate the external and internal. &nbsp;There is a natural order to changes of Yin and Yang in the world and this book is one resource where they have been expounded. &nbsp;What relates to Heaven relates to Earth and the book naturally carries principles for human conduct because what is orderly for the universe&rsquo;s changes will correspond in some way to what is orderly for human beings&rsquo; affairs. &nbsp;What occurs in the celestial bodies will affect the events and transformations that appear in human society as well.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Devoid from our modern science is any incorporation of morality into the world scientific view itself when describing the heavens and Earthly phenomena whereas in ancient Chinese science righteousness is a subject inseparable from discussions of universal changes of Yin and Yang, how one is to view the workings and changes of the world and oneself.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">In the Book of Changes, Yin and Yang are represented in the form of individual lines. &nbsp;Three of these lines will make a trigram. &nbsp;There are eight total (2^3). &nbsp;A line is either broken, which stands for Yin, or it is unbroken, which stands for Yang. </span></p><p class="c87"><span class="c90">&#9776;&#9777;&#9778;&#9779;&#9780;&#9781;&#9782;&#9783;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">These trigrams are symbols that provide the foundation for representing an &nbsp;even larger composite unit of Yin and Yang, called the hexagram, which is made of two trigrams, one stacked on top of the other. &nbsp;There are 64 hexagrams (2^6). &nbsp;In ancient Chinese science, there are multiple concepts like this that serve to reflect Yin and Yang in the form of composite units, allowing a view of universal principles beyond just the stated duality that is present in all things. &nbsp;What is also important is that when there is a hexagram, there are multiple aspects discussed to gain insight into its meaning: the hexagram is discussed for what it is by itself, the two trigrams that compose the symbol are mentioned and related to why the hexagram is what it is (including the effect of their respective positions). &nbsp;What happens when the individual lines of the hexagram are in transition is also important.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Key to the issue, and part of explaining Yin and Yang, is that these hexagrams&rsquo; lines will be undergoing a state of transition. &nbsp;So these hexagrams allow us to get more insight into how Yin and Yang manifest. &nbsp;For any divination reading, there will be produced the first hexagram and then at the same time information about the second hexagram towards which it is moving.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Corresponding to all the things around us that we have come to know, Yin and Yang are in constant change and can transform into each other. &nbsp;The river&rsquo;s stream is constantly flowing and is not stationary. &nbsp;The image we might have of it being stable is a sample of time we make, perhaps from visiting it once or over a week or month, because as we know the seasons are always in play, meaning that the river will look different from season to season and the weather that affects it will change it even throughout a day and throughout any month. &nbsp;Over longer expanses of time, the rocks and flora change around the river and the banks might be different. &nbsp;Over even longer stretches of time the terrain shifts and the river might expand, branch off, move or contract. &nbsp;Thus this concept we have of a river and its state of existence being stable for the most part is actually not right. &nbsp;It is always surrounded by many aspects of change, but we rarely discuss the world around us in these terms in modern science, which might be averse to it. &nbsp;So to have a more valuable view of the world we have to discuss the world like this.</span></p><p class="c1"><span>Yin and yang are in change and they are to be found in everything. We might appreciate them more when we understand numbers as more than more human activity; they are connected to the universe and they are directly related to Yin and Yang. When studying mathematics from ancient China, odd numbers are classified as yang and even numbers are considered yin. &nbsp;Odd and even numbers are an interconnected and complementary duality, alternating across whole number sequences.</span></p><ul class="c18 lst-kix_8rw0uyjjewf-0 start"><li class="c0 li-bullet-0"><span class="c6">Yin manifests in situations of coolness, contraction, and inward movement. &nbsp;It gives rise to darkness, femininity, coldness, and passivity. &nbsp;It is often symbolized by the moon and water. &nbsp;In ancient discussions, Yin represents Earth, the terrain, when it is viewed in opposition to Heaven, the celestial. &nbsp;In the seasons its peak manifestation relative to Yang occurs during winter.</span></li></ul><ul class="c18 lst-kix_8rw0uyjjewf-1 start"><li class="c1 c21 li-bullet-0"><span class="c6">Even Numbers: Even numbers exhibit symmetry, which is an aspect of yin. &nbsp;They can be divided into two equal parts without leaving a remainder. Evenness can be called a receiving and passive quality; the Yin principle is characterized by its passive, receptive nature. The ability of even numbers to be divided into two equal parts without leaving a remainder is seen as a reflection of balance. &nbsp;The number two, being the smallest even number, represents duality, partnership, and the balance between opposing forces. &nbsp; &nbsp;Something even or symmetrical provides a foundation (e.g. base) or a structure (e.g. columns) that can be built upon. &nbsp;Even numbers represent stability, balance, and duality. &nbsp;Stability and receiving are related.</span></li></ul><p class="c1 c4"><span class="c6"></span></p><ul class="c18 lst-kix_8rw0uyjjewf-0"><li class="c0 li-bullet-0"><span class="c6">Yang embodies heat, expansion, and outward motion. &nbsp;It is associated with qualities like brightness, masculinity, warmth, and activity.

Odd numbers are inherently asymmetric, meaning they cannot be divided evenly. This uniqueness and lack of symmetry are characteristic of the yang principle, which is active, assertive, and projective. The number one, in particular, is considered the ultimate Yang number, representing unity, the beginning, and the active force that initiates change. Since odd numbers cannot be divided into two equal parts without leaving a remainder, they are seen as singular, dynamic and unbalanced in a way that mirrors the active, expansive nature of Yang. &nbsp;Odd numbers represent activity, change, and singularity.</span></li></ul><p class="c1 c4"><span class="c6"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c6">Distinctions for the Modern Mind.</span></p><ul class="c18 lst-kix_gcnid21om1ii-0 start"><li class="c0 li-bullet-0"><span class="c66 c28">Yang: Assertive, Strong, Dynamic, Energetic, Ordering, and Active</span></li><li class="c0 li-bullet-0"><span class="c28 c66">Yin: Receiving, Passive, Weak, Stabilizing, Structuring, and Passive.</span></li></ul><p class="c1 c4"><span class="c6"></span></p><p class="c1 c4"><span class="c6"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c6">Passive Structure (Yin) vs. Active Ordering (Yang): A majority proportion of the stabilizing and structuring of yin with a minority proportion of the strengthening and ordering of Yang produces the Metal element.

These phases reflect the natural ebb and flow of energy that is vital for the regeneration and sustainability of all living things. &nbsp;According to the Dao, everything in the universe follows its own natural course, and this natural flow is what leads to harmony. Thus, the seasonal shifts between yin and yang are not seen as imbalances in a negative sense but as part of the dao&mdash;the natural and harmonious way of the world.In practical terms, this means that during winter, when yin energy is dominant, it is a time for rest, introspection, and conservation of energy. This period of inward focus and slowing down is essential for the renewal and rejuvenation that will lead to the outward expression of energy in the yang-dominant summer months. Conversely, summer&#39;s yang energy encourages growth, activity, and outward expression, which is balanced by the return to yin energy in the autumn and winter. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c6">So then we need to explain what is the opposite, which is an imbalance we want to correct. &nbsp;In the context of yin and yang, an imbalance that needs correction refers to a situation where the natural harmony between these two forces is disrupted in a way that leads to disharmony, illness, or dysfunction, rather than the natural ebb and flow observed in the seasons. &nbsp;The changing, dynamic proportions of yin and yang are not imbalances in themselves when they are following the natural ebb and flow of the Tao or the natural order of the universe.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c6">With respect to yin and yang one thing we should point out is that wintertime seems imbalanced, being mostly Yin, but it is in harmony as a phase of the seasons all the same, and thus this is a different kind of imbalance from there being disorder. &nbsp;It is often mentioned that yin and yang should be put into balance but they are also freq in different proportions that are not equal</span></p><p class="c1 c4"><span class="c6"></span></p><p class="c1 c4"><span class="c6"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Both yin and yang are present in any situation discussed, which makes the theory quite different from modern scientific thinking. &nbsp;Importantly, each contains the seed of the other. &nbsp;A concept that cannot be found in our Western, empirical science, the forces of yin and yang are interconnected, interdependent, and in constant change. &nbsp;A rarely emphasized fact when they are mentioned today in popular culture is that they are present throughout both the natural world as well as the purportedly psychological concepts we live by; they form the basis of all phenomena ranging from nature, health, to worldly human affairs. &nbsp;Thus the range described by ancient Chinese science is far more expansive, covering the whole of reality as opposed to the modern science that focuses on individual parts and studies them separately.</span></p><p class="c1 c4"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1 c4"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1 c4"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1 c4"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c44 c5 c16">Luoshu</span></p><p class="c1 c4"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">In the Luoshu, the interdependence of yin and yang, even and odd, and a multitude of other associations is shown.</span></p><p class="c1 c4"><span class="c2"></span></p><a id="t.ddb06de30fc6fc8b2af581f314c7d4de3b80a971"></a><a id="t.0"></a><table class="c54"><tr class="c48"><td class="c72" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c33"><span class="c60 c12">4</span></p></td><td class="c64" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c33"><span class="c2">9</span></p></td><td class="c59" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c33"><span class="c60 c12">2</span></p></td></tr><tr class="c48"><td class="c85" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c33"><span class="c2">3</span></p></td><td class="c64" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c33"><span class="c2">5</span></p></td><td class="c94" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c33"><span class="c2">7</span></p></td></tr><tr class="c48"><td class="c72" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c33"><span class="c60 c12">8</span></p></td><td class="c64" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c33"><span class="c2">1</span></p></td><td class="c59" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c33"><span class="c60 c12">6</span></p></td></tr></table><p class="c1"><span class="c2">All rows, columns, and main diagonals sum to the same value (15 in the original Luoshu). &nbsp;The common modern reaction to this profound property of the Luoshu is that it is a mere mathematical curiosity. &nbsp;And this is mostly how it can be found discussed in the West, something placed in the category of puzzles and pastimes&mdash; even though it is not a puzzle. &nbsp;This view stems from a modern habit of mind which believes that if something carries deeper significance it will present a great deal of complexity initially, it will require a lot of expertise in that subject to grasp its basic level. &nbsp;Those who study mathematics, for example, have studied a multitude of subjects within the field, built up by many (ordinary human) contributors over centuries, and there are customs and standards for becoming an investigator in the field. &nbsp;So how can this Luoshu have depth beyond a parlor trick compared to all of those centuries of human academic activity? &nbsp;Consequently, its modern nickname is &ldquo;magic square&rdquo; as if it belongs in the store section next to an illusionist&rsquo;s card trick and board games. &nbsp;If that remains the understanding for a person, no progress can be made in understanding ancient Chinese science. &nbsp;The essential issue is that it exhibits interdependence of numbers that cannot be explained by ordinary human mathematical theory. &nbsp;When we observe that property we are all truly at a loss of what it means and where it comes from. &nbsp;And at all times, throughout a person&rsquo;s lifetime, whether he is young or old, this will remain a truth. &nbsp; When we count sequentially we cannot necessarily sense the interdependence of the digits. &nbsp;But when the interdependence of those numbers is revealed in the Luoshu arrangement, the modern man will respond that it is well known how to construct the square. &nbsp;But in the first place, the issue of how to construct it is an altogether different issue from the central matter at hand, which is that it reveals that there is indeed a side of number theory inaccessible to mankind; it reveals that truth. &nbsp; Secondly, the construction methods were handed down from ancient times and not developed by moderns. &nbsp;How exactly can numbers be interdependent in this arrangement? &nbsp;We can never answer that! &nbsp;Not as ordinary humans. &nbsp;Explained in different terms, there are higher realms of the universe that reflect mathematics into the human world where we undertake our mathematical activities, and they have provided this Luoshu to us, which sits next to us as we do whatever we do in mathematics and secular knowledge throughout the course of our lives. &nbsp;That it doesn&rsquo;t take much to recognize the interdependence says nothing to diminish its profundity from this perspective. &nbsp;That the Luoshu has the form of something simple on the outside is already known as the way a modern person will be deceived. &nbsp;The Luoshu is a bridge from the earthly to the heavenly and an insight into the mundane world as it relates to the heavens. &nbsp;This profundity demands, in fact, spiritual introspection and humble admission that its interdependence of numbers is a parallel issue to human mathematical issue, that it stands on its own. &nbsp;We can&#39;t overlook something because it is profound under the surface, as outward complexity is equated with significance and vice-versa. &nbsp;The confusion arises because it isn&rsquo;t that people are supposed to be tested in math class on this Luoshu. &nbsp;Rather, as people learn mathematics they can look to this as a reference for deeper truths.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">In ancient Chinese science, the interdependence between elements in the Luoshu are not just numerical but tied to other aspects of the universe, other ways in which yin and yang manifest.</span></p><p class="c1 c4"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">A Collection of Theories</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">As we mentioned, yin is associated with something inner and yang is associated with something outer, yet according to the Book of Changes, when there is Tai (Peace) this results from an overall state in which yang sits inside and yin sits outside, thus demonstrating the complexity of yin and yang. &nbsp;The key point is that this is complexity of a different sort, one that is not endlessly accumulative of separate theories working in separate domains. &nbsp;Each major theory in ancient Chinese science, be it the 64 hexagrams in the Book of Changes, the Lo Shu diagram, and the Five Elements interrelate and build upon each other.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Creation and Destruction: The dynamic interplay of Yin and Yang is seen as the driving force behind all creation and destruction in the universe.

Daytime, with its light, warmth, and energy, is Yang, while nighttime, with its darkness, coolness, and rest, is Yin. The transition between day and night is a continuous cycle of Yin and Yang energy: dawn, morning, noon, afternoon, evening, dusk, night, and so on. </span><span>Without day there isn&rsquo;t night; to have one necessarily implies the existence of the other. &nbsp;Light shines somewhat during night with the stars. &nbsp;A hint of night is present during the day with the appearance of the moon or stars.</span></li><li class="c29 c9 c13 li-bullet-0"><span class="c10 c5">Male and Female:</span><span class="c6">&nbsp;In ancient Chinese thought, the male and female genders are described in terms of Yang and Yin, respectively. This is not limited to biological differences. It extends into the associated energetic and social roles that were always associated with each gender. &nbsp;Women are primarily the yin element and men the yang. &nbsp;At the same time, within each individual, there is a balance of both Yin and Yang. &nbsp;A human body contains both regardless of the person&rsquo;s gender.</span></li><li class="c29 c9 c13 li-bullet-0"><span class="c10 c5">Motion and Stillness:</span><span class="c6">&nbsp;In martial arts and physical activities, the concept of Yin and Yang is often applied.

This cycle is evident in the growth and decay of plants and the rise and fall of civilizations. &nbsp;The decay of dead plants provides the soil for new plants to grow.</span></li><li class="c29 c9 c13 li-bullet-0"><span class="c10 c5">Joy and Sorrow:</span><span class="c10 c28">&nbsp;In the realm of human emotions, joy can be considered Yang (active, outgoing) and sadness can be considered Yin (stationary, internal), respectively. &nbsp;Just as night follows day, sadness or disappointment often follows joy, and vice versa, reflecting the natural ebb and flow of emotional states. &nbsp;Thus in many spiritual traditions the objective is to rid oneself of emotions such as these so as to free oneself from being dragged around by them.</span></li></ul><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Since the human body is made of yin and yang and the universe is as well, this explains one point of how all things in the world can have interconnection. &nbsp;The macroscale can be reflected in the microscale. &nbsp; TCM sees the human body as a microcosm of the universe, where the same principles and forces that govern the universe also operate within the human body. &nbsp;This is a concept in contrast with modern science in which material constituents like atoms and molecules do make up humans and larger matter but humans are not considered comparable in any interconnected constituency to the rest of the universe. &nbsp;In the traditional view the primal forces of yin and yang underlie all things large and small, so there is no problem making connections amidst things that have been studied as separate in our science. &nbsp;Accordingly, concepts (seasons, organs of the human body) that we consider essentially unconnected in Western empirical science will have processes and relations in parallel because they exhibit the same elemental qualities.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">The interaction and transformation between Yin and Yang underlies everything and through them balance and harmony are maintained. &nbsp;In traditional Chinese medicine, if something is not working in the human body there is an imbalance of yin or yang. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">At the same time, one can find that yin and yang are in fact principles already discussed in modern science just unknowingly: positive and negative charges in electricity, north and south poles in electromagnetism, and the discovery that positive and negative charges are always coexistent with north and south poles (of magnetism) are exactly concepts caused by yin and yang. &nbsp;At different levels and from different angles they can be found in electromagnetism. They balance, oppose, interact, and complement each other.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">In many cases modern science has been accumulating, from the periphery, large volumes of facts about phenomena that can be unified by applying yin and yang at the core like this. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">It is often superior to approach a modern scientific subject by assessing the presence of yin and yang in the situation.</span></p><p class="c1 c4"><span class="c2"></span></p><h2 class="c1 c22" id="h.go0hhr22tuxe"><span class="c8">The Five Elements</span></h2><p class="c1"><span class="c2">In ancient Chinese science there is alongside Yin and Yang the Five Elements. &nbsp;Yin and yang together in various combinations compose each of the elements in the Five Elements theory. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">To make an analogy, whereas yin and yang might be like describing the individual boards and their nails in building construction, the Five Elements might be conceived of as larger structural units made of yin and yang, such as the wall framing sections, ceiling joists, floor joists, or trusses that are made up of boards and nails.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">The Five Elements are composite units of yin and yang that are in change and can transform into each other. &nbsp;At the same time each element is made of a proportion of yin and yang, the relationships between the Five Elements themselves, how they affect each other, are describable in terms of yin and yang as well. &nbsp;The Five Elements Theory is discussing five elements composed of yin and yang which is why the Five Elements are also said to make up every manifestation in the universe. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">As we mentioned, different sections of a building, such as wall framing or trusses, are made from the same basic materials: boards and nails but wall framing and trusses serve different structural purposes. &nbsp;The board and nails can be reconfigured or repurposed in various ways. &nbsp;This is like talking about the Five Elements. &nbsp;Each has its distinct role (in making up the house) but each is also made of yin and yang.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">What is important to point out after this analogy has been used is that each element is not just a material substance but a phase of energy or a step in a cycle of transformation. &nbsp;And associated with each element is a set of qualities that reflects its constituent proportion of yin and yang. &nbsp;Each element has a set of attributes that make it affect the others.</span></p><ul class="c18 lst-kix_pram9m1v6bma-0 start"><li class="c0 li-bullet-0"><span class="c2">Wood represents growth and expansion.(rising yang, declining yin)</span></li><li class="c0 li-bullet-0"><span class="c2">Fire symbolizes energy, passion, and transformation.

Bees rely on flowers for their source of nectar and pollen, while flowers rely on bees for pollination, ensuring their reproduction and continuation of their species.</span></li><li class="c0 li-bullet-0"><span class="c5">Yin and Yang</span><span class="c2">: In this context, the bee can be seen as representing the active, the yang principle, while the flower embodies the passive, the yin principle. The bee actively gathers nectar and pollinates flowers, exhibiting the dynamic, assertive qualities associated with yang. In contrast, the flower remains rooted, receiving the bee&#39;s actions, exemplifying the receptive, yielding nature of yin.</span></li><li class="c0 li-bullet-0"><span class="c5">Harmonious Balance</span><span class="c2">: Despite their opposing differences in form, bees and flowers exist in a harmonious balance, fulfilling their respective roles. The bee&#39;s yang energy is complemented by the flower&#39;s yin energy, creating a balanced and mutually beneficial relationship.</span></li><li class="c0 li-bullet-0"><span class="c5">Cyclic Transformation</span><span class="c2">: In the cycle of life, the bee and flower relationship reflects the constant transformation between yin and yang. The bee&#39;s pollination activities lead to the creation of new flowers, which in turn provide sustenance for future generations of bees, forming an endless cycle of interdependence and transformation.</span></li></ul><p class="c1"><span class="c2">This is a situation when seemingly opposing forces are interconnected, interdependent, and in constant flux, achieving a state of harmony and balance within the natural order.</span></p><p class="c1"><span>Most noticeable in weather phenomena, at any point, yin and yang might be unbalanced or in conflict then head towards resolution.</span></p><h3 class="c17" id="h.v0r43qn4zndu"><span class="c23 c5">The Pollen</span></h3><p class="c1"><span class="c2">As we will see by examining pollen, the Yin is present in Yang and Yang is in present Yin. &nbsp;Which aspect of Yin and Yang appies will change depending on which angle and level is used to discuss the situation.</span></p><ul class="c18 lst-kix_g67ti7tu289u-0 start"><li class="c0 li-bullet-0"><span class="c5">Pollen relative to flowers</span><span class="c2">: We said that the flower is Yin relative to the bee, Yang. &nbsp;Within the flower itself however, from a Taiji viewpoint, pollen represents the yang (active, creative) aspect of the flower&#39;s reproductive cycle. The flower, specifically the pistil (the female part of the flower), represents the yin aspect. </span></li></ul><p class="c1 c13"><span class="c2">Pollen is a fine to coarse powdery substance comprising pollen grains, which are male microgametophytes of seed plants, which produce male gametes (sperm cells). It is the essence of the flower&#39;s masculine energy, containing genetic material necessary for creating new life. When bees transfer pollen between flowers, they facilitate the union of yang energies (the pollen) and yin (the receptive, feminine flower, to the pistil), allowing for the creation of seeds and the continuation of the plant&#39;s life cycle. &nbsp;</span></p><ul class="c18 lst-kix_g67ti7tu289u-1 start"><li class="c1 c21 li-bullet-0"><span class="c2">When bees or other pollinators move from flower to flower in search of nectar or pollen as food, they often carry pollen grains on their bodies. This can lead to the transfer of pollen from the male part of a flower (the stamen, specifically the anther) to the female part of a flower (the pistil, specifically the stigma) of a different flower of the same species. This transfer is known as pollination.</span></li><li class="c1 c21 li-bullet-0"><span class="c2">The flower will have to get pollen from another flower. &nbsp;Its own pollen should be made use of by a different flower.</span></li></ul><p class="c1 c24 c4"><span class="c2"></span></p><ul class="c18 lst-kix_g67ti7tu289u-0"><li class="c0 li-bullet-0"><span class="c5">Pollen to bees</span><span class="c2">: For bees, pollen serves multiple functions that reflect Taiji&rsquo;s mutual benefit and interdependence:</span></li></ul><ul class="c18 lst-kix_g67ti7tu289u-1 start"><li class="c1 c21 li-bullet-0"><span class="c5">Nourishment </span><span class="c2">(yin aspect): Pollen provides essential proteins, vitamins, and minerals that bees need for their own health and the development of young bees in the hive. This nurturing role represents the yin quality of pollen for bees. &nbsp;So whereas the bees transport the pollen among flowers, they also use it themselves.</span></li><li class="c1 c21 li-bullet-0"><span class="c5">Energy source</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;(yang aspect): Pollen, along with nectar, fuels the bees&#39; activities, providing the energy they need for flight, foraging, and hive maintenance. This energizing function embodies the yang quality of pollen for bees.</span></li><li class="c1 c21 li-bullet-0"><span class="c5">Balance and harmony</span><span class="c2">: The collection and use of pollen by bees exemplify the Taiji principle of balance. Bees take what they need from flowers while simultaneously providing a crucial service (pollination) to the plants. This mutually beneficial relationship demonstrates the harmonious interplay of seemingly opposite forces in nature.</span></li><li class="c1 c21 li-bullet-0"><span class="c5">Transformation</span><span>: In Taiji philosophy, change and transformation are constant. Bees </span><span>transform</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;pollen into &quot;bee bread&quot; by mixing it with nectar and enzymes, creating a more easily digestible and storable food source. This transformation process reflects the dynamic nature of qi (life energy) as understood in Taiji.</span></li></ul><p class="c1"><span class="c2">From a Taiji perspective, pollen embodies the principle of dual purpose and interconnectedness. It serves as both a means of reproduction for flowers and a source of sustenance for bees, while also facilitating a larger cycle of ecological balance and mutual benefit. This exemplifies the Taiji concept of harmony through the interaction of complementary forces, where each element plays multiple roles in maintaining the overall balance of nature.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Once pollen grains land on the stigma (part of the pistil), they are nurtured and allowed to germinate, growing a pollen tube towards the ovule&mdash;a process that exemplifies the yin qualities of receptivity and nurturing. &nbsp;This is called fertilization</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Union of Yin and Yang: The transfer of pollen to the flower and the subsequent fertilization process can be seen as the union of yin and yang energies. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Seed Formation: The fertilized ovule develops into a seed, which contains the embryo (the young plant) and a food reserve (endosperm or cotyledons, depending on the plant type). The seed is a dormant structure that can remain inactive for various periods until conditions are right for germination.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Germination and New Plant Growth: When a seed is exposed to the right conditions (such as adequate water, oxygen, and sometimes light), it can germinate. Germination involves the embryo inside the seed beginning to grow, developing a root (radicle) that anchors into the soil and a shoot that grows towards the light. This process results in the establishment of a new plant, which, if it survives to maturity, can itself produce flowers, undergo pollination and fertilization, and produce seeds, thus continuing the life cycle.</span></p><h3 class="c17" id="h.l5yry5nyzenj"><span class="c23 c5">Weaving of Yin and Yang</span></h3><p class="c1"><span class="c2">The relationship between bees, flowers, and pollen, viewed through the lens of yin and yang, offers a rich tapestry of interactions that embody the dynamic balance and interplay of these complementary forces.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">There are a multitude of aspects, levels, and angles in which Yin and Yang apply to bees and the pollination of flowers, as the bees are the Yang, the flowers are the Yin, but the pollen the bees pick up by touching the flower is regarded as Yang, the flower that receives it by way of the bee is yin. &nbsp;The source flower for the pollen is Yin nourishing with the pollen, the destination flower for the pollen is Yin receiving.</span></p><p class="c1 c4"><span class="c2"></span></p><h3 class="c17" id="h.5v23br8osuyu"><span class="c23 c5">The Nectar</span></h3><p class="c1"><span class="c2">In Taiji, nectar represents a balance of yin and yang energies within the flower</span></p><ul class="c18 lst-kix_2do10juj1o4k-0 start"><li class="c0 li-bullet-0"><span class="c5">Nectar relative to the flower</span><span class="c2">:</span></li></ul><ul class="c18 lst-kix_2do10juj1o4k-1 start"><li class="c1 c21 li-bullet-0"><span class="c5">Yin aspect</span><span class="c2">: Nectar is a nurturing, attractive force. It&#39;s the flower&#39;s way of inviting and sustaining pollinators, embodying the receptive, feminine principle of yin.</span></li><li class="c1 c21 li-bullet-0"><span class="c5">Yang aspect</span><span class="c2">: Nectar production requires energy and resources from the plant, representing an active, outward-directed effort to ensure reproduction. This aligns with the yang principle of active creation.</span></li><li class="c1 c21 li-bullet-0"><span class="c5">Transformation</span><span class="c2">: In Taiji, Yang endows and Yin transforms. The flower transforms (Yin) its resources (Yang) into nectar, exemplifying the Taiji concept of constant change and the flow of qi (life energy).</span></li></ul><p class="c1 c24 c4"><span class="c2"></span></p><ul class="c18 lst-kix_2do10juj1o4k-0"><li class="c0 li-bullet-0"><span class="c5">Nectar to bees </span><span class="c2">(for the hive or the bee itself):</span></li></ul><p class="c1 c24"><span class="c2">For bees, nectar serves multiple functions that manifest Taiji principles:</span></p><ul class="c18 lst-kix_2do10juj1o4k-1"><li class="c1 c21 li-bullet-0"><span class="c5">Energy source (yang aspect)</span><span class="c2">: Nectar provides carbohydrates, serving as the primary energy source for bees. This fuels their active, yang-oriented tasks such as flying, foraging, and maintaining the hive.</span></li><li class="c1 c21 li-bullet-0"><span class="c5">&nbsp;Honey production (yin aspect)</span><span class="c2">: Bees transform nectar into honey through a process of regurgitation and evaporation. This stored food represents the yin principle of preservation and nurturing, ensuring the hive&#39;s survival during times of scarcity.</span></li><li class="c1 c21 li-bullet-0"><span class="c5">Balance and harmony</span><span class="c2">: The relationship between bees and nectar demonstrates the Taiji concept of mutual benefit. Bees receive sustenance while flowers receive pollination services, illustrating the harmonious interplay of seemingly opposite forces in nature.</span></li><li class="c1 c21 li-bullet-0"><span class="c5">Cycle of transformation</span><span class="c2">: The process of collecting nectar, converting it to honey, and using it for energy exemplifies the Taiji principle of cyclic transformation. Energy flows from flower to bee to hive and back to the environment in a continuous cycle.</span></li><li class="c1 c21 li-bullet-0"><span class="c5">Unity of opposites</span><span class="c2">: Nectar represents both a gift from the flower and a reward for the bee&#39;s pollination service. This dual nature reflects the Taiji concept that apparent opposites are actually complementary aspects of a greater whole.</span></li><li class="c1 c21 li-bullet-0"><span class="c5">Adaptability</span><span class="c2">: Different flowers produce different types and amounts of nectar, and bees must adapt their foraging strategies accordingly. This reflects the Taiji principle of flexibility and responsiveness to change.</span></li></ul><p class="c1 c4"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Thus at different levels and aspects of the relationship between bees and flowers manifest yin and yang promptly.</span></p><p class="c1 c4"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1 c13"><span class="c51 c16 c28">When Heaven and Earth were founded, they divided to make yin and yang.

fundamental components of the universe. &nbsp;They comprise every phenomenon in the universe, including all matter. &nbsp;They are Water, Wood, Fire, Earth, and Metal. &nbsp;Each one is composed of the more primal forces of yin and yang. A specific element&#39;s unique proportion of yin and yang gives rise to its distinctive properties and behaviors. &nbsp;The relationships occurring between these elements can also be described in terms of yin and yang. Thus, this ancient Chinese scientific theory is complete in its means of description. &nbsp;</span></h2><h2 class="c39 c38" id="h.wffwias77u4c"><span class="c12">Contrary to modern interpretations of the Five Elements, they are in fact matter, they are not symbolic at any point. &nbsp;It is that the ancient understanding of matter was altogether different and encompassed more dimensions of experience, contained more that was known to be alive, much of which we currently regard as conceptual in a modern scientific frame of thinking. &nbsp;To us, a season would not be composed of matter but is just a concept. &nbsp;In ancient times, everything </span><span class="c12">is alive</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;and part of the larger whole with the smaller being seen in the larger and vice versa. &nbsp;Since a season has been divinely arranged as part of the natural order of things progressing, it actually is composed of matter, one of the Five Elements. &nbsp;Reality expands into the material therefore, making this theory much more powerful than modern science.</span></h2><p class="c9"><span class="c2">Understanding the Five elements requires a shift in mindset, as initially it does not make sense to the modern mind that parts of the world would be composed of Wood when this is a material found in plants. &nbsp;Additionally, it takes more than the conventional accounts and diagrams a person can find online and contemporary books and knowledge to grasp because in fact much has been lost to the empirical industry. To be able to realize what it is about you have to go beyond what is taught in Traditional Chinese Medicine in modern times because in actuality they have only partially correct understandings and are not practitioners of a cultivation path.</span></p><p class="c9 c4"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c9"><span class="c2">This Five Elements theory is not to be equated with something like a &ldquo;Five Atomic Elements&rdquo; and then the names of things found on our planet or experienced by people placed underneath those five categories. &nbsp; That is our initial inclination, but it isn&rsquo;t the right understanding. Wood as an element embodies a spectrum of general characteristics, states, relationships, and attributes that are not part of modern scientific descriptions when discussing particles: growth, decline, undermining, supporting, springing forth, moving out of dormancy into activity, etc. aren&rsquo;t the terms used. &nbsp; These are states and qualities that are not part of our modern scientific investigation and discourse. &nbsp;One could say that we are cut off from them because they sound so irrelevant to modern thinking. &nbsp;Coinciding with that, these attributes are reflecting the spiritual aspect embodied in the universe that the progressive emphasis on the mundane throughout history has now occluded for us. </span></p><p class="c9 c4"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c9"><span class="c2">An atomic element is a modern scientific theory investigating matter while speaking in terms of laws of phenomenal, behavioral properties and states of matter. &nbsp;What will the chemical do, how does it interact, and under what conditions does it do a thing or refuse to do a thing? &nbsp;That basically describes the whole of modern science in its objectives to understand the world. &nbsp;The Five Elements emphasizes what we know in everyday life to be true: everything in the universe is in a process of changing, rising and falling. &nbsp;The two approaches are fundamentally different.</span></p><p class="c9 c4"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c9"><span class="c2">Would you then rather ride on horseback instead of drive a car and thereby see much less of the world? &nbsp;We can&rsquo;t answer that question at this point because if you go further maybe you will understand how some people in ancient China could do things you wouldn&rsquo;t believe, conditions of life that are much better than traveling in a car or airplane. </span></p><p class="c9 c4"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c9"><span class="c2">What&rsquo;s more, there is a startling fact that as soon as you apply yin and yang and the Five Elements to modern scientific theories you can take in knowledge as a whole that would take you much longer if you were to take the usual path of collecting facts and data, as yin and yang truly describe phenomena.</span></p><h2 class="c1 c22" id="h.dzo5paqo3jgt"><span class="c8">The Standard Circle Diagram</span></h2><h2 class="c39 c38" id="h.7u4fl9sgicvu-1"><span class="c12">Typically the Five Elements are introduced by presenting them in the form of a circular diagram that serves to illustrate how they affect and transition into one another. &nbsp;It presents the direction of effect in two cycles, called </span><span class="c12 c47">generating </span><span class="c12">and </span><span class="c12 c47">controlling. &nbsp;</span><span class="c12">In the generating cycle, a given element will produce or support the element that sits next to it moving in the clockwise direction. &nbsp;In the controlling cycle, an element controls, undermines, or insults the element that sits two steps over moving in the clockwise direction, indicated by the arrows that are internal to the circle.</span><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 624.00px; height: 742.67px;"><img alt="" src="images/image5.png" style="width: 624.00px; height: 742.67px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);" title=""></span></h2><h2 class="c39 c38 c91" id="h.ae0zmgbz12xw"><span class="c2"></span></h2><h2 class="c39 c38" id="h.7u4fl9sgicvu-2"><span class="c2">In the above arrangement, the diagram only conveys the fact that there are two cycles, with one supporting and one insulting. This is far from enough for the beginner. A person will inevitably ask how Metal produces Water in the same way that Wood obviously produces Fire. &nbsp;It does not, and there should be clarification as to why that is the case, because otherwise the theory sounds nebulous.</span></h2><ul class="c18 lst-kix_x40le3yzx8pv-0 start"><li class="c38 c13 c39 li-bullet-0"><h2 id="h.z7copmc0tqm1" style="display:inline"><span class="c12">When Wood generates the Fire element, and the Fire generates Earth, these two instances manifest the </span><span class="c12">yang</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;side of the generative cycle. &nbsp;Wood acts directly as the medium for Fire to burn and when Fire burns it directly produces ash, which makes more Earth. &nbsp;So in both cases the elements are providing overt support or generation. &nbsp;</span></h2></li><li class="c39 c38 c13 li-bullet-0"><h2 id="h.9kshl6rki9um" style="display:inline"><span class="c2">Earth sits somewhere in between this and something more passive: in its support for the Metal element, it both bears (yin) and refines (yang) Metal in the ground. &nbsp;</span></h2></li><li class="c39 c38 c13 li-bullet-0"><h2 id="h.wglc6i92dyn6" style="display:inline"><span class="c2">When we get to the yin aspects of the support/generative cycle, they are playing an indirect role in the production of the next element: Metal is not part of the production of Water but provides conditions for it to form, such as condensation. &nbsp;This is the yin aspect side of the generative cycle; these two elements are not the actual media that produces the next element. &nbsp;Water produces Wood in the same way. Water nourishes plants, a yin activity, but this does not directly comprise the wood material, the substantial part of the plant.</span></h2></li></ul><h2 class="c39 c38" id="h.bxkt8c5mou5v"><span class="c2">When the theory is so foreign and inscrutable when perceived with our modern minds, the conventional cycles diagram needs to be expanded or provided notes to make the theory understandable. &nbsp;Especially when this vague diagram is paired with a table or list of phenomena associated with each element, the diagram can give a shallow impression of the theory and relegate it to a collection of historical information. The person&rsquo;s understanding becomes flat, inaccurate, and oriented towards rote memorization of categories instead of an understanding. This is because the Five Elements are not merely a set of classifications for phenomena but a deep, interwoven system of principles that apply to things large and small in the universe. &nbsp;The associations themselves should make the Five Elements clearer and how they embody yin and yang. &nbsp;To receive that impression of the theory requires a different entry point than what one finds in most books today.</span></h2><h2 class="c1 c22" id="h.d2faq0vrvf6q"><span class="c8">Converting the Circle Diagram Into a Wave</span></h2><h2 class="c39 c38" id="h.7u4fl9sgicvu-3"><span class="c2">As the path of a circle is followed, it is unending. Matching this, the form of a circle can be represented as a continuous wave, as taught in trigonometry, to embody more aspects of the Five Elements in a diagram and reformulate its presentation. &nbsp;We plot the same associations along the corresponding wave. &nbsp;First, the proportion of yin and yang at each point and in each element is made more obvious when they are positioned along a wave. &nbsp;Furthermore, we generally perceive time linearly today and so this arrangement makes it easier to follow the progression of the Five Elements over time, whether it is the seasons of the year or the hours of the day. Since our circle diagram is divided into five portions, this sine wave is as well. &nbsp;On our graph, the y-axis plots Yang in the positive (up) direction and Yin in the negative (down) direction. &nbsp;The x-axis represents the progression of time if the elements are viewed in their relation to time, but this arrangement also functions as a chart.</span></h2><h2 class="c39 c38" id="h.n7aym4utkva"><span class="c2">For the benefit of the newcomer, this wave presentation expresses the interconnection, associations, and phases of the Five Elements in such a way that there is more integrated information.</span></h2><h2 class="c1 c67" id="h.n7aym4utkva-4"><span class="c2">[graph]</span></h2><h1 class="c1 c3" id="h.nmo79ot0rv52"><span class="c45 c28"></span></h1><h1 class="c1 c22" id="h.4lcq69cia5pr"><span>The </span><span class="c45 c28">Five Elements Described in Progression</span></h1><p class="c9"><span class="c2">Each element, while having its unique characteristics, is a product of the interplay between Yin and Yang. &nbsp;Their constant change showcases the ever-changing nature of the universe.</span></p><h3 class="c17" id="h.q4yj6iluqufo"><span class="c93">WATER &nbsp;(&#27700;, Shu&#464;)</span></h3><p class="c1"><span class="c61">|&#9608;&#9608;&#9608;&#9618;&#9618;&#9618;&#9618;&#9618;&#9618;&#9618;&#9618;&#9618;&#9618;&#9618;&#9618;&#9618;&#9618;&#9618;&#9618;&#9618;&#9618;&#9618;&#9618;&#9618;&#9618;&#9618;&#9618;&#9618;&#9618;&#9618;&#9618;&#9618;&#9618;&#9618;&#9618;&#9618;&#9618;&#9618;&#9618;&#9618;&#9618;&#9618;|</span><span class="c5 c61">&nbsp;10% Yang, 90% Yin</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c16">Water is plotted a</span><span>t</span><span class="c16">&nbsp;the trough of the wave. &nbsp;</span><span>Corresponding </span><span class="c16">to this in the physical world is any nat</span><span>ural</span><span class="c16">&nbsp;trough</span><span>,</span><span class="c16">&nbsp;a </span><span>low spot</span><span class="c16">&nbsp;where water settles during cold seasons.

The energy is at its most inward and still, reflecting deep stillness and potential for renewal. &nbsp;In the human life cycle, Winter (Water) represents old age, a period of life that has </span><span>slowed down greatly, </span><span class="c16">characterized by rest, reflection, and the accumulation of wisdom. </span><span>It is also associated with the</span><span class="c16">&nbsp;beginning (conception) of life, </span><span>when dormancy and development is inward-focused, as in the case of the egg.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c16">In terms of the time of day, Winter (Water) is associated with night, particularly midnight, when the world is at its darkest and most still.

In traditional Chinese medicine, Winter (Water) corresponds to the kidneys and bladder, organs associated with storing and purifying. Natural phenomena for Winter (Water) include snow, ice, and wildlife dormancy, reflecting the stillness and inward energy of the season. The colors associated with Winter (Water) are black and dark blue, colors that reflect the depth and stillness of the season. In terms of direction, Winter (Water) is associated with the north, reflecting cold and stillness. The flavor associated with Winter (Water) is salty, reflecting the preserving and purifying qualities of the season. In terms of developmental stages in projects or work, Winter (Water) represents conception and planning, a time of inward reflection and preparation.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">When water freezes, it undergoes a process of cooling and becoming still, which are fundamentally Yin characteristics.

The energy in this phase is marked by rising Yang, with Yang increasing and Yin decreasing. This period signifies new beginnings and development, as life emerges from the dormancy of Winter. &nbsp;In the human life cycle, Spring (Wood) corresponds to childhood, marked by rapid growth, learning, and development. &nbsp;</span><span>Bamboo shoots grow rapidly, embodying Wood&#39;s qualities of growth, flexibility, and upward movement&ndash; growth that is enabled by its antecedent, Water, and the simultaneous rising amounts of sunlight.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c16">In terms of the time of day, Spring (Wood) corresponds to the morning, specifically dawn, when light begins to return and energy starts to rise.

The foundation is made of concrete, wood, or other materials that are solid and stable, embodying the Yin qualities of steadiness and grounding.</span></h2></li><li class="c29 c9 c13 c22 li-bullet-0"><h2 id="h.otdhvgokxznb-6" style="display:inline"><span class="c50 c5">Walls </span><span class="c44 c52 c28">(Metal Element): In the analogy, walls can represent the Metal element.

Water, though seemingly passive and yielding, has the power to shape the landscape over time, carve through rock, and support life&mdash;all of which are active, transformative processes that align with the yang aspect.</span></p><p class="c9 c4"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c9"><span class="c2">Conversely, fire, while materially yang (due to its warmth, dryness, and upward-reaching nature), is said to have a nature rooted in yin. This is because fire, despite its external brightness and energy, consumes and transforms what it touches, leaving darkness and stillness in its wake. Fire&#39;s external display of light and heat is temporary and ultimately leads to a state of depletion or darkness, reflecting the yin aspect of returning to stillness and rest.</span></p><p class="c9 c4"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c9"><span class="c2">The reference to the Supreme Polarity Diagram (also known as the Taiji or Yin-Yang symbol) further illustrates this point. In the diagram, the small dot of opposite color within each side represents the idea that within every yin, there is a seed of yang, and within every yang, there is a seed of yin. This symbolizes the interconnectedness and mutual containment of these forces, highlighting the dynamic balance and transformation that is central to the philosophy of yin and yang.</span></p><p class="c9 c4"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c9"><span class="c2">The nature of water and fire, and by extension all things in the universe, cannot be fully understood by looking at their external appearances or immediate qualities alone. Instead, it requires a deeper appreciation of the underlying principles of yin and yang, which are always at play in a dynamic and complementary manner.</span></p><p class="c9 c4"><span class="c2"></span></p><h2 class="c1 c22" id="h.5m63gz9pb3xu"><span class="c8">Confusion About Yin and Yang</span></h2><p class="c1"><span class="c2">The conventional dichotomies we have taken in from our modern Western education cannot be directly applied to Taiji, as this is something altogether different from what we were taught, the primal forces of Yin and Yang. Apparent contradictions weave, and there is genuine depth to the theory.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">In Taiji, Yin and Yang are not simply opposites; they are complementary forces that interact in all things in the universe. The concepts of hardness and resilience in materials like steel, which in Western thought might be at first perceived as purely Yang characteristics, are understood in Taiji as part of a more complex interplay between Yin and Yang.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">A piece of steel is indeed hard and resilient&mdash;qualities that are typically associated with Yang due to their firmness and ability to withstand pressure. However, Taiji theory goes beyond this superficial understanding. Yang represents energy, activity, and the potential for change, not just material hardness. This means that while steel&#39;s hardness can be seen as a Yang trait, the creation of a solid material involves both Yin and Yang. The Yin aspect provides the structural form, while the Yang aspect contributes to the dynamic properties like sharpness and the ability to cut or pierce.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Fire, as the element with maximum Yang and minimal Yin, embodies this energy and activity to the fullest extent. It represents the ultimate kinetic energy, demonstrating how Yang is not just about hardness or rigidity but about active, transformative power. In contrast, with minimal Yang, substances like Water, which remain liquid, highlight Yin&#39;s adaptability and structural properties without the active forcefulness of Yang.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">The interplay between Yin and Yang is crucial. The Yang aspect of Metal, for example, is seen in its sharpness and dynamic qualities&mdash;its ability to cut and change. However, Metal itself is predominantly Yin, reflecting qualities such as contraction, stability, and structure. This shows that while Yang gives Metal its active properties, it is the Yin aspect that provides the foundational structure.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">When Yang is applied in greater proportion to Yin, the resulting state can be solid, as seen when a liquid becomes sharp and solidified. But in maximum Yang, like Fire, we see a state of kinetic energy and dynamic strength that lacks the stability of structure. Conversely, in maximum Yin, we see conditions that produce a liquid state&mdash;fluid and adaptable but without the hardness that Yang brings.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Thus, the balance and proportion of Yin and Yang determine the qualities of a material or element. A small minority of Yang within a predominantly Yin context can produce a solid, structured material like Metal. Meanwhile, predominant Yin with minimal Yang results in a liquid state like Water, emphasizing adaptability and fluidity.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">The Taiji strength (Yang) is not merely as material resistance but as a form of energy and potential for change. Yin provides the structure and form, but without the active influence of Yang, it remains fluid. The interaction of these primal forces creates the diverse states of matter and energy we observe.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">The conventional dichotomies we have taken in from our modern Western education cannot be directly applied to Taiji, as these are something altogether different from what we were taught, the primal forces of Yin and Yang. Apparent contradictions weave and there is genuine depth to the theory.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">A piece of steel is the hardest we say, and this is experienced tangibly as such. Metal&#39;s hardness and resilience are also Yang characteristics, representing firmness and the ability to withstand pressure. But in Taiji, strength, Yang, isn&#39;t limited to material resistance to deformation (that is, hardness) but about energy, activity, or potential for change. &nbsp;It is its interaction with Yin that produces a solid material. exhibited by the Fire element which is maximum Yang in proportion to minimum Yin. &nbsp;Nothing cuts through like Fire. Yang, virile, is about energy and activity rather than material hardness or rigidity, but with only minimal Yang the substance will be Water, liquid, having structure but no hardness. &nbsp;Thus the product of the two relates to their interaction. &nbsp;The Yang aspect of Metal can be seen in its sharpness and the ability to cut or pierce, demonstrating activity and dynamic qualities. &nbsp;If you make a blob liquid sharp, after all, it becomes solid: the effect of Yang being applied in greater proportion to Yin. &nbsp;But Yang is at its maximum Fire, so when there is more than minority Yang proportional to Yang it will be more loose, for the Earth, Wood.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Yin, while docile or passive. It might be seen in a context as adaptable or providing structure. &nbsp;Yang is not adaptable, as it is wayward when it is in maximum proportion to Yin, as in Fire&mdash; a picture of kinetic energy. &nbsp;Yin is the primal force that provides structure but it will not produce a solid by itself. &nbsp;Rather, by itself it will produce a flowing liquid. &nbsp;There is no structure to the gas that is Fire, yet it is strong. Water is maximally adaptable&mdash; like liquid&mdash; as something docile and passive yet has structure. &nbsp;Structure is not associated with Yang, something that is associated with dispersal. &nbsp;A condition of maximum Yin produces a liquid. &nbsp;A condition of maximum Yang can produce a state of kinetic energy like Fire and this is the strength of Yang. Only when Yang is the in proportion as the small minority to Yin, the structure primal force, will a Metal result. &nbsp;Yin, in maximum proportion to Yang, produces the fluid, Water.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Metal is predominantly Yin, reflecting qualities such as contraction, stability, and structure.</span></p><p class="c1 c4"><span class="c2"></span></p><h2 class="c1 c22" id="h.c5ay8ftcv4xu"><span class="c8">Reincarnation and The Five Elements</span></h2><p class="c1"><span class="c2">In cultivation practices often the goal has been to transcend the Five Elements. &nbsp;Though the Five Elements (Wood, Fire, Earth, Metal, and Water) underlie everything in the realm where humans reside and are linked to the cycles of nature and the human experience, this does include reincarnation, something that the cultivator wants to escape. &nbsp;To go beyond the Five Elements would be to go beyond the physical realm which produces reincarnation; in the processes of the Five Elements there is renewal and decay that mirrors birth and death. &nbsp;To highlight the truth of this, one can point out connections between two seasons, two stages of life and the two elements of Winter and Summer. &nbsp;The season of Winter, associated with Water, carries the dual role of representing the end (death) and the beginning (gestation). &nbsp;Water is maximum yin, associated with contraction, the stage in the cycle when something dies or is at its dormant inception.</span></p><ul class="c18 lst-kix_37fkxp7jnokr-0 start"><li class="c1 c21 li-bullet-0"><span class="c2">Winter (Water element) represents:</span></li></ul><ul class="c18 lst-kix_37fkxp7jnokr-1 start"><li class="c1 c40 c38 li-bullet-0"><span class="c2">Death (the end of a cycle)</span></li><li class="c1 c38 c40 li-bullet-0"><span class="c2">Growth in the womb (new life gestating)</span></li><li class="c1 c40 c38 li-bullet-0"><span class="c2">Infancy (new life emerging)</span></li></ul><ul class="c18 lst-kix_37fkxp7jnokr-0"><li class="c1 c21 li-bullet-0"><span class="c2">Summer (Fire element) represents:</span></li></ul><ul class="c18 lst-kix_37fkxp7jnokr-1 start"><li class="c1 c40 c38 li-bullet-0"><span class="c2">Peak growth and vitality</span></li><li class="c1 c40 c38 li-bullet-0"><span class="c2">Full expression of life force (like a flame burning brightly)</span></li></ul><p class="c1"><span class="c2">This cyclical perspective unveils the perpetual cycle of birth, growth, decay, and rebirth.</span></p><p class="c1 c4"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1 c4"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1 c4"><span class="c2"></span></p><h1 class="c1 c22" id="h.ymgrawexq6b"><span>Applying Ancient Chinese Science to Today</span></h1><p class="c9 c4"><span class="c2"></span></p><h2 class="c1 c22" id="h.ud5m9v2fd755"><span>Mathematics</span></h2><h3 class="c17" id="h.qpqs0dncjyr3"><span class="c23 c28">Within mathematics, as in other aspects of the universe, there are fundamental forces or principles that are opposite yet interconnected, each containing the seed of the other.

is considered a philosophical topic separate from investigation and descriptions of the physical world. &nbsp;In ancient China the Wu Xing (Five Elements) - Water, Wood, Fire, Earth, and Metal - were regarded as the fundamental aspects of what we call &ldquo;reality&rdquo; at the same time they explain the constituents and processes of all things. &nbsp;One could say they are more deep as elementary components; they extend beyond discrete, particulate units of the material, mechanistic reality we perceive in our modern age&mdash; which is what our atomic elements provide us conceptually. &nbsp;If anything exists outside of these atomic elements or their subcomponents, we tend to believe it is our own human concepts projected onto the outside world. &nbsp;If the opposite is permitted, that abstract ideas like the seasons, feelings, tastes, sounds, phases of human life, and even colors are not mere byproducts of our own psychological experience of matter, the Five Elements can be grasped as real and present in everything. &nbsp;The world then has spiritual substance in addition to material presence.</span></p><p class="c58"><span class="c2">In our modern times, we believe our world reality to be essentially molecularly-composed, all of it following physical laws of motion and interactions, whatever the latest physical theory (be it classical mechanics or later quantum descriptions). &nbsp;What we engage with culturally and personally in this fundamentally dispassionate world of motion, energy, and matter are the human concepts we have projected onto it. &nbsp;In our deeply-ingrained conception, nothing exists more than the motion of particles, their reactions, and how they can be described in various situations and levels of scale&mdash; now that we have all matured as a species. &nbsp;In other words, we believe we live, basically, in a mundane space of interacting molecules and whatever subatomic elements and patterns coincide with all of it, from sounds to light, with none of it openly demonstrating anything spiritual we can hold onto, and until it does we have acted with blind faith and irrational. &nbsp;We have come to think of the matter out there as without spirit, merely conforming to laws of science at scale, over time. &nbsp;Modern scientific theories of how physical matter exists at the microscopic levels and acts at the macroscopic level is our interest, as it can provide solutions and practical amenities in the form of technology.</span></p><p class="c58"><span class="c2">The subsequent issue is that any concept we hold&mdash; like a season of the year&mdash; is considered something independently existing from the Periodic Table. &nbsp;If those two were bridgeable, the whatever theory that came forward composed would be all-encompassing and deep. &nbsp; That is in fact what Yin and Yang and the Five Elements are, something lost and difficult to grasp for modern minds. &nbsp;A season of the year is considered particular to our own human understanding, according to the scientific view. &nbsp;We believe, because of science, that humans brought into the world the notion of a season, or our associations we placed on it evolved somehow spontaneously during the course of cultural development. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c58"><span class="c2">By contrast, in the Five Elements an element spans the whole universe because humans are included in it: an emotion is recognized as carrying &nbsp;one or more of the Five Elements. &nbsp;The Five Elements are in turn composed of various proportions of Yin and Yang. &nbsp;Animals emote just like humans do, but so does the planet during its various seasons. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c58"><span class="c2">The properties of these Five Elements are seen as having been established when the universe was generated from Taiji (yin and yang) and so the Wu Xing (Five Elements) exists because of Yin and Yang. &nbsp;The existence of the emotions, the human body, its organs and contents are interrelated because the world is essentially spiritual in nature, it has order and arrangement is not accidental; being alive is a substantial and spiritual matter. &nbsp;The living world is not an assortment of accumulated processes because of what modern physics says matter does over long expanses of time. &nbsp;Rather, the long expanses of time have overseers. &nbsp;They set the stage in which humans live and it is all deeply interconnected. &nbsp;But the theory to reveal this cannot come from the moderns, who are detached from wisdom, prize material experiences and proof at the expense of their spiritual welfare shortly before they reach the end of human life.</span></p><p class="c58"><span class="c2">The Five Elements are Wood, Fire, Earth, Metal, Water. &nbsp;Wood comes from plants, mostly trees, so how can this end-product of plants, something as specific as the internal of a tree, be an element of all things in the world? &nbsp;It must be symbolic somehow. &nbsp;That isn&rsquo;t the right understanding. &nbsp;The Five Elements are regarded as symbolic by those who have not shifted their modern concepts.</span></p><p class="c9"><span class="c2">The Five Elements are not for describing chemical constituents of objects alone. The Five Elements (Wuxing) in Chinese philosophy are ubiquitous and generic in applicability. They represent fundamental qualities present in any situation, paired with dynamic processes that can be found happening between them. &nbsp;They can be applied not only to material and chemical situations (e.g. the Periodic Table, in which elements like Sulfur and Phosphorus are classified as Fire) but also to various aspects of life, nature, organs of the human body (the heart carrying the Fire element, the lungs made of the Metal element), and even what we consider abstract concepts of the mind, such as the seasons of a certain geographic region or process of starting up a business. &nbsp;In the northern hemisphere, the season Winter is paired with Water as it is wet but in another region it would be summer paired with Water. &nbsp;Winter might not have the most quantity precipitation (a modern scientific type of objection) but it is when water dwells and remains dormant along with the living world.</span></p><p class="c9 c4"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c9"><span class="c2">It is all situations that arise in life that can be described or conceived of that the Five Elements comprise. &nbsp;Thus they are actually present elements during an undertaking because an undertaking is known as substantially real. &nbsp;When all matter is understood as having thinking properties, this is a viewpoint that is more easily conceived. &nbsp;It is a view that the universe is made of elements that encompass anything human beings know, observe, and experience, which means it is holistic.</span></p><p class="c9 c4"><span class="c2"></span></p><h2 class="c1 c22" id="h.gy9afycwg4pq"><span class="c8">Electricity, Magnetism, Electromagnetism</span></h2><p class="c9 c4"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c9"><span class="c2">Within electricity, though it can be expressed by the Fire element as maximum Yang and minimum Yin, it consists of two subproperties that are Yin and Yang: the electrical force (Yang) and the magnetic force (Yin), and this is according to electromagnetic theory. &nbsp;Electromagnetic theory states that magnetism is present in electrical current and vice-versa. &nbsp;Then, within each there is Yin and Yang again: the electrical force has two charges consisting of positive (Yang) and negative (Yin), and the magnetic force has two poles, North (Yin) and South (Yang).</span></p><p class="c9 c4"><span class="c2"></span></p><h2 class="c1 c22" id="h.l7btdjv5gb73"><span class="c8">The Periodic Table of Elements</span></h2><p class="c1"><span>The Five Elements (Wuxing) theory not only applies to natural phenomena and traditional practices but also aligns intriguingly with modern scientific concepts. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">First, the atomic elements on the periodic chart are easily shown to be composed of the Five Elements: &nbsp;phosphorus and sulfur, are made of the Fire element, known as combustible. &nbsp;All of the metals on the table embody the Metal element materially as well. &nbsp;Yet a metal like Magnesium that is combustible exhibits properties of both the Metal and Fire elements and is made of both. &nbsp;Mercury is primarily composed of the Metal element but it exhibits properties of liquid, has a higher proportion of yin like the Water element and is thus made of both. &nbsp;The application of intense cold (yin) or heat (yang) often changes the state of any of these elements so that they might be something else. &nbsp;The elements in the Periodic Table are made out of the Five Elements, the Five Elements are made of yin and yang, so the addition of more yin or more yang would change one of its properties, which might be its physical state (solid, gas, liquid).</span></p><p class="c1 c4"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&mdash;-------------------</span></p><p class="c1 c4"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&nbsp;In modern science we would usually thing of the extremes as solid being the most rigid, liquid being in the middle and then gas being on the other end, but in the Five elements it isn&#39;t like this.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Though yin provides structure it is also the docile force in Yin and Yang whereas Yang is known as the virile force. &nbsp;So at maximum Yin though Yin provides the structure in the element, it is docile and therefore a liquid. &nbsp;When Yang is added it becomes more solid as in Earth, Wood, and Metal. &nbsp;When there is little Yin and maximum Yang it is Fire.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Yin is associated with both fluidity (as in water) and structure (as in metal).

The dynamic interplay between these systems, with their contrasting effects on weather, helps maintain the Earth&#39;s atmospheric balance.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Yin (Low-Pressure Systems)</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Characteristics: Yin is often associated with qualities like darkness, coldness, wetness, and passivity. Similarly, low-pressure systems are typically characterized by cloudy skies, precipitation (such as rain or snow), and can lead to cooler temperatures due to the presence of clouds that block sunlight. The rising air within low-pressure systems can be seen as a passive force, drawing in air from surrounding areas.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Interdependence: Just as yin cannot exist without yang, low-pressure systems are interdependent with high-pressure systems. The inflow of air into a low-pressure system is balanced by the outflow of air from high-pressure systems, creating a dynamic balance in the atmosphere.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Yang (High-Pressure Systems):</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Characteristics: Yang is associated with qualities like light, warmth, dryness, and activity. High-pressure systems, with their sinking air, often bring clear skies, warm temperatures (due to increased solar radiation reaching the surface), and dry weather. The active force of air being pushed outwards from a high-pressure system can be seen as yang.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Interdependence: Yang cannot exist without yin. The outflow of air from high-pressure systems helps to create and sustain low-pressure systems by filling the space left by rising air. This interplay between high and low pressure is essential for the movement of air masses and the development of weather patterns.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">In the context of weather, the yin and yang of low- and high-pressure systems work together to create the dynamic and ever-changing weather patterns we experience. Just as yin and yang are not opposing forces but complementary parts of a whole, low- and high-pressure systems are not in conflict but are essential components of the Earth&#39;s atmospheric system, each playing a crucial role in the global circulation of air and the distribution of weather.</span></p><p class="c1 c4"><span class="c2"></span></p><ol class="c18 lst-kix_u4nvzjz3tar2-0 start" start="1"><li class="c0 li-bullet-0"><span class="c2">High Pressure Systems (Yang):</span></li></ol><ul class="c18 lst-kix_u4nvzjz3tar2-1 start"><li class="c1 c21 li-bullet-0"><span class="c2">Active and expansive nature</span></li><li class="c1 c21 li-bullet-0"><span class="c2">Descending air creates clear skies and warmer temperatures</span></li><li class="c1 c21 li-bullet-0"><span class="c2">Pushes outward, influencing surrounding areas</span></li><li class="c1 c21 li-bullet-0"><span class="c2">Associated with stability and fair weather</span></li><li class="c1 c21 li-bullet-0"><span class="c2">Clockwise rotation in the Northern Hemisphere (counter-clockwise in Southern)</span></li><li class="c1 c21 li-bullet-0"><span class="c2">Represents the &quot;giving&quot; or &quot;expressive&quot; aspect</span></li></ul><ol class="c18 lst-kix_u4nvzjz3tar2-0" start="2"><li class="c0 li-bullet-0"><span class="c2">Low Pressure Systems (Yin):</span></li></ol><ul class="c18 lst-kix_u4nvzjz3tar2-1 start"><li class="c1 c21 li-bullet-0"><span class="c2">Receptive and contracting nature</span></li><li class="c1 c21 li-bullet-0"><span class="c2">Rising air creates clouds, precipitation, and cooler temperatures</span></li><li class="c1 c21 li-bullet-0"><span class="c2">Draws inward, pulling in surrounding air</span></li><li class="c1 c21 li-bullet-0"><span class="c2">Associated with change and unsettled weather</span></li><li class="c1 c21 li-bullet-0"><span class="c2">Counter-clockwise rotation in the Northern Hemisphere (clockwise in Southern)</span></li><li class="c1 c21 li-bullet-0"><span class="c2">Represents the &quot;receiving&quot; or &quot;absorbing&quot; aspect</span></li></ul><h3 class="c17 c56" id="h.yrpiooygnq9c"><span class="c23 c5"></span></h3><h3 class="c17" id="h.lt53ubu0x1gj"><span class="c23 c5">The Microscale Describing the Macroscale</span></h3><p class="c1"><span>A person taking a</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;hot (yang) shower will release steam upwards and outwards in the bathroom, but the addition of cold air temperature (yin) by turning on air conditioning will make the steam contract (yin) and fall (yin). &nbsp;The condensation of the water is a yin process, making it denser and heavier, falling downward (yin).

Later, the hexagrams were developed by combining two trigrams, and the text was expanded and commented upon by various scholars, most notably Confucius and his disciples.</span></p><p class="c1 c4"><span class="c2"></span></p><h4 class="c1 c22" id="h.2idq0uczmplh"><span class="c5 c35">Structure and Use</span></h4><p class="c1"><span class="c2">The I Ching&#39;s 64 hexagrams are arranged in a specific order, known as the King Wen sequence, which is believed to reflect the natural flow of change and the cycles of life. Each hexagram is accompanied by a description, known as the &quot;Judgment,&quot; and each line within the hexagram also has its own interpretation. The text also includes various commentaries, the most important of which are the &quot;Ten Wings,&quot; which are attributed to Confucius and his followers.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">To consult the I Ching, one traditionally uses either yarrow stalks or coins to randomly generate a hexagram. The process involves a series of random selections that result in the six lines of the hexagram, which can be either static or changing. Changing lines are those that are in the process of transforming from yin to yang or vice versa, and they indicate a situation that is in flux. The resulting hexagram, along with any changing lines, provides the basis for the reading, which offers insights, advice, or predictions based on the text&#39;s interpretations.</span></p><h4 class="c1 c22" id="h.a1qh4hkjf9ft"><span class="c35 c5">Philosophical Significance</span></h4><p class="c1"><span class="c2">The I Ching&#39;s influence extends beyond China, having been translated into numerous languages and inspiring thinkers, artists, and scholars around the world. Its teachings on the dynamics of change, the importance of balance, and the interplay of opposites have resonated with many, offering a timeless wisdom that continues to be relevant in the modern world.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">The Book of Changes is a rich and multifaceted work that has played a significant role in Chinese culture and philosophy for centuries. Its enduring appeal lies in its ability to offer guidance and wisdom in the face of life&#39;s uncertainties, while also providing a framework for understanding the fundamental principles of the universe. Whether used for divination, philosophical reflection, or both, the I Ching remains a source of inspiration and insight for people around the globe.</span></p><p class="c1 c4"><span class="c2"></span></p><h3 class="c17" id="h.yj4bk5st7vy4"><span class="c23 c5">Describing The 64 Hexagrams in Terms of Modern Meteorology</span></h3><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Weather appears to be a valuable way to gain an immediate overall picture of the 64 hexagrams because favorability or unfavorability of weather conditions mirrors the experiences and challenges of life.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Each hexagram has a composition, like how a crystalline structure has one. The positions of the yin (divided) and yang (uninterrupted) lines indicate the hexagram. &nbsp;But reflecting the conditions of change in the world, the hexagram is in a process of transitioning into the next one or it eventually will.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">A totally yang hexagram (#1) would produce summertime conditions. &nbsp;High pressure is yang, so is clear skies and sunny weather. #2 is much like winter weather that is stable even when wintry and overcast.</span></p><ol class="c18 lst-kix_npcwv2fj5gq-0 start" start="1"><li class="c0 li-bullet-0"><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 22.00px; height: 22.00px;"><img alt="" src="images/image3.png" style="width: 22.00px; height: 22.00px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);" title=""></span><span class="c5">&nbsp;</span><span>The Creative</span><span class="c5">&nbsp;(Qi&aacute;n) </span><span class="c2">&nbsp;: Clear skies, high pressure, sunny weather.</span></li><li class="c0 li-bullet-0"><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 22.00px; height: 22.00px;"><img alt="" src="images/image6.png" style="width: 22.00px; height: 22.00px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);" title=""></span><span class="c5">&nbsp; </span><span>The Receptive </span><span class="c5">(K&#363;n) </span><span class="c2">: Overcast skies, stable weather, mild temperatures.</span></li><li class="c0 li-bullet-0"><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 22.00px; height: 22.00px;"><img alt="" src="images/image10.png" style="width: 22.00px; height: 22.00px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);" title=""></span><span class="c5">&nbsp;</span><span>Difficulty at the Beginning </span><span class="c5">(Zh&#363;n)</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span class="c2">: Stormy weather, thunderstorms.</span></li><li class="c0 li-bullet-0"><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 22.00px; height: 22.00px;"><img alt="" src="images/image16.png" style="width: 22.00px; height: 22.00px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);" title=""></span><span>&nbsp;Youthful Folly </span><span class="c5">(M&eacute;ng)</span><span class="c2">: Foggy conditions, limited visibility.

The text suggests that understanding these patterns can help us anticipate and prepare for future changes.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Interconnectedness: The impact of weather is felt by everyone in a given area, reflecting the interconnectedness of all things, a central theme in the I Ching. Just as weather affects us all, the I Ching teaches that our actions and the changes we experience are part of a larger, interconnected whole.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Favorability and Unfavorability: Just as some weather conditions are more favorable for outdoor activities or travel, certain hexagrams in the I Ching are seen as more auspicious for undertaking new ventures or making decisions. This does not mean that unfavorable conditions or hexagrams are bad; rather, they suggest that caution or a different approach may be needed.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">By using weather as a metaphor, one can more easily grasp the essence of the 64 hexagrams and the wisdom they contain. The I Ching, through its hexagrams, encourages us to be mindful of the ever-changing nature of life and to find balance and harmony within these changes.</span></p><p class="c1 c4"><span class="c2"></span></p><h1 class="c1 c22" id="h.d6fo9hlgbyx1"><span class="c45 c28">Hetu and Luoshu </span></h1><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Hetu and Luoshu are two ancient diagrams in Chinese culture, often associated with cosmology, numerology, and the I Ching (Yijing). They are believed to contain profound meanings and have been influential in various aspects of Chinese thought, including philosophy, feng shui, and Taoism. Despite their significance, the exact origins of these diagrams are shrouded in mystery, and they are often surrounded by myth and legend.</span></p><p class="c1 c4"><span class="c2"></span></p><h2 class="c1 c22" id="h.2lixygq3ps2z"><span class="c8">Hetu</span></h2><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Hetu (&#27827;&#22270;), literally meaning &quot;River Chart,&quot; is one of the two fundamental diagrams in Chinese metaphysics. According to legend, the Hetu was revealed on the back of a dragon-horse (qilin) that emerged from the Yellow River during the reign of the mythological Emperor Fu Xi (c. 2852 BCE - 2737 BCE). The Hetu is depicted as a chart with black and white dots arranged in a specific pattern. These dots are grouped in sets of one to nine and are believed to represent the fundamental principles of the universe, including the five elements (wood, fire, earth, metal, and water), yin and yang, and the cardinal directions.</span></p><p class="c1 c4"><span class="c2"></span></p><h2 class="c1 c22" id="h.vzhwycrld9a6"><span class="c8">Luoshu</span></h2><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Luoshu (&#27931;&#20070;), or &quot;Luo River Writing,&quot; is the other fundamental diagram. Legend has it that the Luoshu was presented on the back of a turtle from the Luo River during the reign of the legendary Emperor Yu the Great (c. 2205 BCE - 2198 BCE). The Luoshu is represented as a magic square, a grid of numbers where the sum of the numbers in each row, column, and diagonal is the same. The traditional Luoshu is a 3x3 grid with the numbers one through nine arranged in such a way that each line adds up to fifteen. This diagram is also deeply symbolic, representing the harmony and balance of the universe.</span></p><p class="c1 c4"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Hetu vs. Luoshu</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">While both the Hetu and Luoshu are revered for their cosmological and numerological significance, they are distinct in their symbolism and legend of origin:</span></p><p class="c1 c4"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Origin and Legend: The Hetu is associated with the Yellow River and Emperor Fu Xi, while the Luoshu is linked to the Luo River and Emperor Yu the Great.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Representation: The Hetu is depicted with dots representing numbers and elements, focusing on the five elements and their interactions. The Luoshu is represented as a magic square, emphasizing mathematical harmony and balance.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Symbolism: Both diagrams are rich in symbolism, but the Hetu is often seen as representing the natural order and the Luoshu as embodying the principles of governance and social order.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">In Chinese metaphysics, the Hetu and Luoshu are considered complementary, representing different aspects of the universe and its underlying principles. They have been influential in various fields, including philosophy, divination, and the organization of space in accordance with feng shui principles</span></p><p class="c1 c4"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1 c4"><span class="c2"></span></p><h1 class="c1 c22" id="h.k8m8nl4e9h5d"><span class="c45 c28">&mdash;-------------------------------------------</span></h1><h1 class="c1 c22" id="h.6lww7y3gblgf"><span class="c45 c28">&mdash;SCRAP</span></h1><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&nbsp;</span></p><h3 class="c17" id="h.6n9qnydw9j6w"><span class="c23 c5">WOOD CONTROLLING EARTH</span></h3><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Trees and plants take over the Earth quickly; they grow between rocks, through sidewalks, and must be trimmed back from buildings.
