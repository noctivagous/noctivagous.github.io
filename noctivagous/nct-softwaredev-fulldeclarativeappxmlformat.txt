A Declarative Application XML Format

--> Is cross-platform as long as a runtime is built for any
given programming language and system.


Patterns occur in the code of application software development that
can be rearchitected into higher-level components inside a declarative
app format, one that builds on top of the past, such as MXML and XUL.  
In short, there are many app scenarios that could be set up completely 
in a declarative file format, it's just that there needs to be more 
conveniences and other conventions that identify.
A calculator is an example we use because it should be describable through
a provided set of higher-level components that make it easy to construct 
at the outset.  A set of these components will be utilized in other app
scenarios as well.
The XML app formats of the past just did not have the conveniences and other 
conventions to make the apps fully self-contained.  The issue being addresed 
is that app SDKs are still providing very low level conventions for writing
apps, such as having people write inside keyDown event functions, because
they are just adding functions, variables, and classes to the code.

This kit can be developed while testing it against different scenarios,
calculator, a tetris-style game, vector-editor, and then.




Consider:
    - Programming inside keyDown, mouseDown, mouseDragged, etc. for more
    than simple scenarios is too low level and is the wrong software 
    architecture for apps with complex input schematics.
        - The example problem: programming each keypress and what it does inside 
        a keyDown event function vs. a keyMappings property list that
        defines actions (functions to call) for keyDown, keyUp.  This then
        can be wrapped inside an input context so that it is self-contained
        and separated from other parts of the app.  For the same window,
        different inputContexts might be swapped out.

    - This is then rearchitected to a higher level and into
    a different set of concepts.  
        - An inputContext covers a set of input definitions (e.g. key mappings)
        for a loaded context, which can be swapped out.  Within an inputContext, there
        are additional conventions to make swapping out different types of
        input interactions possible.  Thus other aspects become modular
        and swappable.
    - Conventions are provided in this application format
    and states and workflows are natively supported.


APPLICATION SETUP

- app <app id="com.example.calculator" version="1.0">
- appSettings


- Application Scenes <appScene>
--- Like game scenes, can be swapped out.
--- Can be inside a <window> or wrap a <window> or <windowGroup>.



INPUT CONTEXTS

- Input Contexts <inputContext>
--- Swaps out the events within an appScene.
--- example:
    In an inputContext, a list of buttons (<button>), such as for a calculator,
    carry an attribute not only for what happens when they are pressed (onPress),
    but also a keyMapping attribute to indicate which key activates
    them.  By placing them inside a inputContext, their
    keyMappings


KEY MAPPINGS

- Key Mappings <keyMapping>
---Is a property list placed inside an input context for keyboard actions.
It can cover 


- Key Mapping Action <keymappingAction event="keyDown">
--- Placed inside a <keyMapping>.



<keymapping keyCode="48" label="0">
                        <keymappingAction event="keyDown" target="#display" action="append" value="0"/>
                    </keymapping>
                    <keymapping keyCode="49" label="1">
                        <keymappingAction event="keyDown" target="#display" action="append" value="1"/>
                    </keymapping>
                    <keymapping keyCode="50" label="2">
                        <keymappingAction event="keyDown" target="#display" action="append" value="2"/>
                    </keymapping>
      
                    
ARRAYS

- Selected Item Array <selectedItemArray>,<selectedItemsArray> 
--- Wraps a list that has a selected index
--- For multiple scenarios both inside the code and to set up GUI controls with indices.
--- Default index value is 0



- Converters <converter>
--- <valueConverter name="radToDeg" type="float" ... >


---

<app> 
<appScene name="Calculator"> 
<inputContext> 
<!-- selectedItemArray wraps a list, allows swapping active element, such as swapping out the active keyMapping ---> <selectedItemArray active="first"> <keyMappings> <keymapping hid="" keyCode="1" modifiers=""> <keymappingAction event="keyDown"> </keymappingAction> </keymapping> </keyMappings> </selectedItemArray> </inputContext> </appScene> </app>
