NCT PAINT - PROFESSIONAL UI DESIGN REQUIREMENTS
===============================================

DESIGN PHILOSOPHY
-----------------

NCT Paint must achieve the visual precision and professional appearance of high-end audio applications like Pro Tools, Logic Pro, Ableton Live, and Reaper. This means moving beyond typical web app aesthetics to create a truly professional-grade interface that respects design fundamentals.

GRID SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS
-------------------------

**Baseline Grid Alignment**
- All text elements must align to a consistent baseline grid (typically 4px, 8px, or 12px)
- Typography should use precise line-height calculations to maintain grid alignment
- Vertical rhythm must be maintained across all UI components

**Modular Grid System**
- Interface elements organized on a strict modular grid
- Consistent spacing units (8px, 16px, 24px, 32px multiples)
- All panels, buttons, and controls snap to grid intersections
- No arbitrary positioning or "eyeballed" layouts

**Pixel-Perfect Precision**
- All elements positioned at exact pixel boundaries
- No sub-pixel rendering that causes blurry edges
- Crisp lines, borders, and typography at all zoom levels
- HiDPI/Retina display optimization with proper scaling

PROFESSIONAL VISUAL STANDARDS
------------------------------

**Color Palette**
- Sophisticated, muted color schemes like pro audio apps
- Dark themes with carefully chosen accent colors
- High contrast ratios for accessibility and professional appearance
- Consistent color usage across all interface elements
- Light shading like 2000s.

**Typography**
- Professional-grade fonts (system fonts or carefully chosen web fonts)
- Consistent font sizing hierarchy
- Proper letter-spacing and line-height for readability
- No default browser font rendering

**Component Design**
- Custom-styled form controls (no default browser inputs)
- Professional button designs with proper states (hover, active, disabled)
- Sophisticated panel layouts with proper visual hierarchy
- Consistent iconography and visual language

TECHNICAL IMPLEMENTATION STRATEGIES
-----------------------------------

**CSS Grid and Flexbox Mastery**
- Use CSS Grid for main layout structure
- Flexbox for component-level alignment
- Avoid floats and positioning hacks
- Proper use of gap properties for consistent spacing

**Custom CSS Variables**
- Define spacing scale as CSS custom properties
- Consistent color palette in variables
- Typography scale defined systematically
- Easy theme switching capability

**Precise Measurements**
- Use rem/em units for scalable typography
- Pixel units for borders and fine details
- Consistent use of calc() for complex spacing
- Avoid magic numbers in CSS

**Component Architecture**
- Modular CSS architecture (BEM methodology or similar)
- Reusable component classes
- Consistent naming conventions
- Scalable and maintainable code structure

AVOIDING WEB APP PITFALLS
-------------------------

**Common Web Design Mistakes to Avoid**
- Default browser styling bleeding through
- Inconsistent spacing and alignment
- Poor typography rendering
- Rounded corners everywhere (use sparingly and consistently)
- Overly bright or saturated colors
- Inconsistent button and form styling

**Professional Polish Details**
- Subtle shadows and depth (not excessive)
- Proper focus states for keyboard navigation
- Smooth, purposeful animations (not gratuitous)
- Loading states and micro-interactions
- Consistent hover and active states

REFERENCE APPLICATIONS FOR INSPIRATION
--------------------------------------

**Pro Audio Applications**
- Ableton Live: Clean, grid-based layout with excellent use of space
- Logic Pro: Sophisticated panel organization and visual hierarchy
- Pro Tools: Professional color schemes and precise alignment
- Reaper: Efficient use of screen real estate and consistent styling

**Design Principles from These Apps**
- Information density without clutter
- Consistent visual language across all panels
- Sophisticated use of negative space
- Professional color palettes (grays, muted colors)
- Precise alignment and spacing
- Clear visual hierarchy
