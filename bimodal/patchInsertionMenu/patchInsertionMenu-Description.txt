For a node-based programming / patch-based programming system:


A context-sensitive insertion menu appears at the mouse cursor position when
triggered by the insertion key.  After the 'I' key is pressed, 
a popover appears with categories of patches in
tabs at the top.  The popover encloses a tab view. Press number keys 1-5 to
switch between patch categories 
(Audio - 1 , Graphics - 2, Logic - 3, Control - 4, Utility - 5).


Inside each tab's container is a grid of the patches for the category 
with squares that have visual patch icons with names and descriptions.

This is a searchable, categorized browser for selecting and inserting patches 
into the workspace.

Receiving focus at the same time is a live search textfield where it is possible 
to type instantly to filter patches by name or keywords within that open category 
(the open tab).


Interaction Flow

Press 'I' → Menu opens at cursor position 
Type → Search filters patches in real-time 
1-5 keys → Switch between categories 
Arrow keys → Navigate patch grid
Enter → Insert selected patch at original cursor location 
Escape → Cancel and close menu

The system combines the speed of keyboard shortcuts with the discoverability of
visual browsing, making it efficient for both power users and newcomers to
quickly find and insert the patches they need.

It makes use of key-clicks, which means that individual keyboard keys replace
clicks while the mouse is used to move the cursor.

This is for a system that is completely built around key-clicks.
