nct-softwaredev-guidelinebasedlayouts-grounduppage

Pages built from the ground up.
By default, guidelines are strictly layout objects 
(invisible, weightless, exactly like in every other constraint system).
In this system, you can make them visible when you explicitly want to
and you can use the system to fill in their boxes or ContentAreas


- Styles applied to guidelines
    - For the 4 inset edges (guidelines) generated for one scaffold layer,
    a style is applied and it is turned into 3pt black line.
    - Its resulting box can have a background color or image applied.
    
    
  ContentArea.left   → style stroke: 3pt #000000
  ContentArea.right  → style stroke: 3pt #000000
  ContentArea.top    → style stroke: 3pt #000000
  ContentArea.bottom → style stroke: 3pt #000000
  ContentArea.box    → background: #FFF9F0, cornerRadius: 24pt
  
  
- Functions for filling in content
    - a set of images are distributed across a set of boxes (populate them).
    
    
No separate “container view” is required – the scaffold itself is the styled frame.

• Content-fill helper functions (one-liner population)

subdivideAndFillImages(
images: [ImageAsset],
columns: 3,
rows: auto,
hGutter: 12pt,
vGutter: 12pt,
inset: 20pt,
fitMode: cover | contain | stretch
)


One call measures the images, creates a perfect grid scaffold inside the caller, places each image into its own cell, and applies the chosen fit mode.
Other instant-fill helpers include:

subdivideAndFillText(lines: [String], …)
subdivideAndFillCards(components: [Card], columns: 4, …)
distributeEvenly(views: [View], direction: horizontal | vertical, spacing: 16pt)

These primitives let an entire page – background, decorative frames, grids, and content – be authored in just a handful of declarative lines, with zero nested view wrappers and full designer–developer parity because every line and box is a visible, named guideline or scaffold.
