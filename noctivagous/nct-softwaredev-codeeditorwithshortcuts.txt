The code editors (IDEs) were never built out like normal applications that help you do your job, where for example you could insert a function template with Alt/Opt+F, an object class template with Alt/Opt+C, or go through a step-by-step walkthrough to configure something  large and complicated in the code project.  They don't do these things.

Alt/Opt+D - Declare a variable or object. 
    --> Followed by letter of variable type 
    I for integer, F for float, S for string, etc.
    
    O for object
    --> followed by object

Insert Template:

    Alt/Opt+F - Function
    Alt/Opt+C - Class
    Alt/Opt+I - If statement
    Alt/Opt+S - Switch
    Alt/Opt+V - Variable


    [key combination] - switch to configure mode
    so that it collects information in keyboard-controlled
    menu slides before inserting the template to complete
    some of its parameters (e.g. return value).
