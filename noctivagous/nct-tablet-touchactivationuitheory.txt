Why Direct Touch of Buttons on Tablets And Mobile Devices Is Often 
Unpleasant (Interfaces with Changing Buttons)

CASE EXAMPLE

It is less taxing cognitively for the user of 
a tablet device to touch a button that is located on a grid 
(such as an app on the homescreen) by getting to it the following way:

First, set up buttons to the left and above the grid for
the rows and columns.  These will be used to locate
the button to be pressed.

1) Press the button to indicate its row (located just to the left of its row on the grid)
2) Press the button to indicate its column (located just above its column on the 
grid) 

The button is then activated.

This is actually more natural to do than touching the button directly.


THEORY

- In the 1970s, machine interfaces were translated to 
the personal desktop computer screen at Xerox PARC, with 
the buttons represented with pixels and clicked by the mouse 
cursor.  For the first time, users were pressing machine
buttons consecutively in an interactive scheme.
- Buttons that activate functions originally come from panels on physical, 
electronic or mechanical machines. Pressing buttons once 
within a long period is normally how these machines are used.
They were not live machines, like musical instruments. 
Therefore the spatial coordination required to hit a button 
on physical equipment (machines) is only occasional.
- The issue is that using buttons as a continuous interface for manipulating 
software interfaces is something else.  If the physical device,
such as the desktop computer or tablet is not designed properly
to be live, the spatial coordination will be more taxing than it appears.
