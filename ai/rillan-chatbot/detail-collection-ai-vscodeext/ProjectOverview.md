# Rillan AI Workflow Interface - Project Overview for AI Agents

## 🎯 Project Purpose
The Rillan AI Workflow Interface is a VS Code extension that intelligently bridges the gap between AI assistants and users by collecting detailed project specifications through context-aware forms. Instead of users providing vague requests like "make a calculator app," this system guides them to provide comprehensive details needed for AI to generate better results.

## 🏗️ Architecture Overview

### Core Components
```
├── extension.ts           # Main extension entry point & command handlers
├── contextAnalyzer.ts     # AI-powered request analysis & categorization  
├── detailCollectorPanel.ts # Dynamic webview UI generation
└── test/                  # Test suite with VS Code integration
```

### Data Flow
1. **User Input** → Context Analyzer analyzes request type/complexity
2. **Context Analysis** → Detail Collector generates appropriate forms
3. **Form Interaction** → User provides detailed specifications
4. **Data Export** → Structured JSON saved to workspace (.rillan-ai/ folder)

## 🧠 Context Analysis System

### Request Classification
The `ContextAnalyzer` automatically categorizes user requests into:
- **Code Projects**: Software, apps, scripts, algorithms
- **Image/Art**: Graphics, illustrations, designs, logos
- **Text Content**: Articles, stories, documentation, copy
- **Video/Animation**: Motion graphics, videos, animations
- **Web Projects**: Websites, web apps, landing pages
- **App Development**: Mobile/desktop applications
- **Other**: General or uncategorized requests

### Complexity Assessment
Three levels determined by keyword analysis:
- **Simple**: Basic, straightforward projects (1-2 major components)
- **Medium**: Multi-feature projects (3-5 major components) 
- **Complex**: Enterprise-level projects (6+ major components)

### Dynamic Form Generation
Based on type + complexity, the system generates contextually relevant forms with:
- Type-specific fields (programming language for code, art style for images)
- Complexity-appropriate detail levels
- Smart defaults and suggestions
- Validation and error handling

## 🎨 User Interface

### Three Interaction Methods
1. **Start Detail Collection**: Full workflow with analysis → form → export
2. **Show Detail Collector**: Direct access to form interface
3. **Quick Collection**: Streamlined VS Code native interface

### Webview Implementation
- Modern, VS Code-native styling using CSS custom properties
- Responsive design adapting to different project types
- Real-time form validation and user feedback
- Contextual help and suggestions throughout

## 🔧 Technical Implementation

### Key Technologies
- **TypeScript**: Strict typing for reliability
- **VS Code Extension API**: Native integration
- **Webview API**: Interactive form rendering
- **Node.js**: File system operations
- **Mocha**: Testing framework

### Extension Manifest (package.json)

### Context Analysis Engine
The `ContextAnalyzer` class uses keyword-based pattern matching to:
- Detect project type through domain-specific vocabularies
- Assess complexity through scope and feature indicators
- Generate appropriate detail collection categories
- Provide intelligent suggestions and approaches

Example classification logic:
```typescript
if (this.containsCodeKeywords(request)) type = 'code';
else if (this.containsImageKeywords(request)) type = 'image';
// ... additional type detection

const complexity = this.assessComplexity(request);
const categories = this.generateDetailCategories(type);
```

## 🎮 User Workflows

### Typical Usage Pattern
1. **Activation**: User runs command from Command Palette
2. **Request Input**: User describes what they want to create
3. **Analysis**: System determines project type and complexity
4. **Context Review**: User sees analysis with suggested approach
5. **Detail Collection**: User fills contextually relevant form
6. **Export**: Structured data saved to workspace for AI consumption

### Example: Building a Calculator App
```
Input: "Build a calculator app with scientific functions"
Analysis: Type=Code, Complexity=Medium
Form Generated: 
- Project name/description
- Programming language preference
- Platform targeting (web/mobile/desktop)
- UI framework selection
- Feature specifications
- Testing requirements
Output: JSON file with structured specifications
```

## 📊 Data Export Format

All collected details are saved as JSON files in `.rillan-ai/` folder:
```json
{
  "timestamp": "2024-01-15T10:30:00.000Z",
  "details": {
    "userRequest": "Build a calculator app",
    "context": {
      "type": "code",
      "complexity": "medium",
      "suggestedApproach": "...",
      "categories": [...]
    },
    "projectName": "Scientific Calculator",
    "description": "...",
    "language": "JavaScript",
    // ... additional collected details
  }
}
```

## 🔮 Integration Points for AI Agents

### Input Processing
AI agents should look for exported JSON files in `.rillan-ai/` folder containing:
- Original user request context
- Structured project specifications
- Type and complexity metadata
- User preferences and constraints

### Response Enhancement
Use collected details to:
- Generate more accurate code/content
- Apply user-specified preferences
- Respect complexity requirements
- Follow suggested approaches

### Workflow Integration
This extension serves as a "pre-processor" for AI interactions:
1. User expresses intent → Detail collection → Structured specs
2. AI consumes structured specs → More accurate output
3. Feedback loop improves future detail collection

## 🚀 Extension Points

### Adding New Project Types
1. Add type detection logic in `contextAnalyzer.ts`
2. Create type-specific detail categories
3. Update UI templates in `detailCollectorPanel.ts`
4. Add test coverage

### Custom Detail Categories
The system is designed for extensibility:
- Detail categories are data-driven
- Form rendering is dynamic
- Export format accommodates arbitrary fields
- Validation rules are configurable

## 📈 Success Metrics
