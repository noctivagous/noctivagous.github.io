Going Beyond The 2022 ChatGPT Format

The next generation of AI chatbot web app should be a focus of the AI industry. To begin with, we can recognize that the current AI chatbot software is often being put into modes by the user, such as step-by-step walkthrough (a step–result–interpret loop).  Already the AI chatbot apps give examples for the user to follow for how to use the chatbot, such as having it quiz or teach a subject, but this is quite hacky because the GUI doesn't change when the AI is used for different tasks.  Whatever mode it has been placed into like this is forced inside the same scrolling chat.  Since these instructions ("start quizzing me on...") are actually instructing the AI to interact in different modes, for each mode the GUI of the app should change.  

The app layout for a step-by-step walkthrough mode would be one where there is one slide shown at a time.  This can be used when asking the AI how to troubleshoot a computer or diagnose a repair issue.  The author of this article has made use of AI chatbots in this mode while configuring Linux, which is a relatively complex system. To simulate a walkthrough mode in today's scrolling chatbot GUI, give it the following prompt: "I want to [e.g.: optimize the speed of my Linux system with the Terminal].  Let's do this one step at a time and I give you results. A step–result–interpret loop."  This is definitely better for the task than the default use of the chatbot, which would just generate a list of instructions to follow, because complexities can arise at each step when working with the Terminal and the AI can respond according to the output that the user reports back to it.  Each step, in which the AI either gathers information or gives instructions and asks for the results, is presented one at a time, with a text input area underneath for the user to insert results.  It's much better if the GUI of the chatbot app adapts to this scenario and other types of modes are collected.  In a new type of chatbot, it will make a big difference that there are designated modes offered to the user paired with corresponding GUI and workflows.  The design of the software will be different than just a plain chat. When the user approaches the software, there are entry points provided for how to use it.

Other modes include one that gathers information in the form of questionnaires, either all at once on a single form or spread out one question at a time, before taking action, such as to set up a software development project or any type of project where there are placeholders it can generate.   Another mode would be a teaching mode for course instruction, and the GUI would change to accommodate that, too.

The extensibility of the chatbot software is another topic.  These modes can be programmed and supplied by users in the form of files that have a sequence and flow descriptor (declarative) data format.  It will describe which GUI to use for a mode and include the prompt text to go along with it.  By doing all of this, the AI chatbot of today, which has remained the same since 2022, can go beyond a one-size-fits-all vertical scrolling GUI.

It's also the case that if given a set of workflow components and GUI controls, the AI could put together its own GUI forms and sequences for any situation. At the same time, though, a stock set of modes will provide known usage of the AI and structure for it. It is better to guide the AI today than to let itdo what it wants.
If this AI app is running on the desktop, it can be given an AI agent that is allowed to execute apps and open up windows, which would allow it to generate an on-the-fly orientation for a user to an app that is unfamiliar.


In the future, it could be the case that the AI is given a set of complete application kit components and wires up its own apps on the fly.
