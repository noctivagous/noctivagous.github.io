Moving Past iOS for The Future of Tablet Devices

iOS has a major drawback: the simplest tasks are very easy to achieve but anything slightly complicated has to be memorized.  A user can easily activate one of iOS's many side features on accident and this is a poor state of UI. But actually, iOS is an undeveloped and prototype-level set of user interface conventions.  Because it strives towards minimalism, it is nubby, dumbed down, and evokes feelings of interacting with playground equipment. It insists on doing without accessory physical controls like knobs, sliders, or buttons.  Steve Jobs just knew what mattered at the time-- to put together a tablet UI that actually worked for the hands, and he brought in the multitouch technologies that had recently been introduced by researchers.  This can sell a lot of devices because anyone from the public can use what iOS provides.  But making the device blunt in its simplicity comes at a steep cost, because eventually the apps that people want to use are more complicated and there is no way for them to fit into a scheme.  iOS is ideologically narrow.  It doesn’t have anything to accommodate complex usage of a computer, so now there are trackpads and keyboard sold for these tablets, to turn them into PCs.  The theory of the PC was developed over a period of years by Douglas Engelbart and Xerox PARC.  By comparison, the theory behind iOS mostly a set of bare conveniences to accommodate the multitouch “gestures,” to launch apps and press buttons inside them.  "Easy to use" shouldn't be equated with "no effort needed to understand it at all."

Touch Modifier Keys

For example, if three modifier keys sat on the edge of the tablet, they could modify what a touch means when it is pressed.  An object sits there on the screen, but what does the touch mean?  When one modifier key is pressed (“close”), what the finger touches will be closed, for example.   This will then allow the user to specify the purpose of a touch (or even a “gesture”) before making a press.  Of course if there are several touch modifier keys, they can accommodate a wide range of purpose.  A “generate” modifier will generate an object in an empty space or as a child object of the touched object on the screen.
