AGENTIC CODE EDITOR

An agentic IDE run inside a Chrome extension and thus have access to the devtools. 
It would be an editor that stores projects in IndexDB but exports them when 
the user wants. It would run on the client end. It could use CodeMirror and 
then a GUI framework.

The agent should not read entire files but still be able to act “agentically,” 
by representing code and documents as structured trees.

-> This can be turned into an MCP server for existing code agents to use.

It will interact with a parser and get varying levels of detail and 
then just send commands to the parser and review the results.
Instead of the agent trying to “own” the source text, you make a parser 
the central authority. The agent then only needs to send commands 
to the parser, and review structured results at varying levels of detail.
The agent doesn’t need to read files itself. It just sends intention-level 
commands to the parser (like list, insert, replace, remove), and then 
reviews the results to decide the next step.
 
 command API (like a set of verbs the agent would send to the parser: 
 list, inspect, insert, replace, delete, generate).
 If the agent were naïvely walking the tree and micromanaging every 
 little node, it could easily end up making many small calls to the parser. 
 But the system can be designed to balance granularity and efficiency.
 
In practice: Use summaries and snapshots for observation. Use 
single intention commands for modifications. Let the parser handle detail, 
so the agent isn’t sending floods of micro-requests.

TWO TREES: THE CODE TREE AND THELogic Tree  
maintaining two complementary trees:

Code Tree (AST / Source Representation)
	- Produced by a parser.
	- Knows how the program is written (syntax, tokens, structure).

Example: “this function adds two numbers using a + operator.”

Logic Tree (Semantic Representation / Flow Tree)
	- Abstracted view of what the program does.
	-Captures intent and relationships, not syntax.

Example: “this function computes the sum of its two parameters.”

 
Workflow

Parser builds AST.

Mapper transforms AST → Logic Tree.

Agent reasons on Logic Tree (e.g., “duplicate addition logic detected”).

Agent maps intent back into a parser command against the AST.

Parser generates code.

✅ In this setup, the agent never confuses syntax with semantics. It can:

Use the Code Tree to guarantee correct syntax.

Use the Logic Tree to reason about program meaning, efficiency, and refactoring.


If your goal is agentic assistance without raw file reading, I’d lean toward:

	- AST if you want to do serious code reasoning.

	- Custom JSON tree if you want something lightweight and language-agnostic.


Here’s a **minimal JSON-tree representation** for a project file, along with how an agent could traverse and act on it.

---

## Example: JSON Tree Representation

```json
{
  "type": "file",
  "name": "app.js",
  "children": [
    {
      "type": "function",
      "name": "addNumbers",
      "params": ["a", "b"],
      "body": [
        {
          "type": "return",
          "expression": {
            "type": "binary",
            "operator": "+",
            "left": "a",
            "right": "b"
          }
        }
      ]
    },
    {
      "type": "function",
      "name": "addNumbersCopy",
      "params": ["a", "b"],
      "body": [
        {
          "type": "return",
          "expression": {
            "type": "binary",
            "operator": "+",
            "left": "a",
            "right": "b"
          }
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

This represents a file (`app.js`) with **two functions** that are structurally identical.

---

## How the Agent Traverses

1. **Walk the Tree**

   * Visit `file` → `children`.
   * For each `function`, compare structure (`params`, `body`).

2. **Detect Pattern**

   * Finds that `addNumbers` and `addNumbersCopy` have identical AST-like bodies.

3. **Raise Observational Question**

   * *“I notice two identical functions (`addNumbers` and `addNumbersCopy`). Do you want me to remove the duplicate?”*

4. **Propose Action**

   * Safe action = delete duplicate subtree (`addNumbersCopy`).

---

## Why This Works Well

* The **agent doesn’t read raw file text**—it just traverses nodes.
* Each node is semantically clear (`function`, `return`, `binary`).
* You can add **metadata** to nodes (e.g., source line numbers, documentation, lint warnings).
* Tree traversal is cheap and deterministic.

---

## Next Step Possibilities

* **Custom Rules**: Define rules like “all functions must have JSDoc” → agent checks node type `function` and `docstring`.
* **Transformations**: Convert repeated `<binary>` expressions into helper functions.
* **Live Preview Integration**: Map this JSON-tree to a DOM preview tree for web apps.

---

Would you like me to **draft a minimal traversal algorithm (in JavaScript)** that walks such a JSON tree, detects duplicate functions, and proposes a safe edit?


Excellent questions — they go right to the heart of what a **tree-based agentic code editor** would mean in practice. Let’s walk through them step by step.

---

## 1. How Would the Agent Add Code to the Tree?

* **Node Creation**: Adding code means **inserting new nodes** into the JSON tree. For example, if the user asks for a new function, the agent creates a `function` node with `params` and `body` children.
* **Safe Placement**: The agent determines where to insert by traversing to the parent node (`children` of type `file`, `class`, or `block`).
* **Schema Validation**: The tree has a schema (e.g., a `function` must have `params` and `body`), so the agent generates a valid subtree instead of free text.

Example — Add a `multiplyNumbers` function:

```json
{
  "type": "function",
  "name": "multiplyNumbers",
  "params": ["a", "b"],
  "body": [
    {
      "type": "return",
      "expression": {
        "type": "binary",
        "operator": "*",
        "left": "a",
        "right": "b"
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

This is just appended to the file’s `children` array.

---

## 2. How Would the Agent Make Code Files?

* **Tree → Text Code**:
  A **code generator** walks the tree and turns it back into source text.

  * `function` node → `"function addNumbers(a, b) { return a + b; }"`.
  * The traversal respects indentation, formatting rules, and language syntax.
* **Round-Trip**:

  1. Parse existing file → tree.
  2. Modify tree (by agent or user).
  3. Generate code from tree → save/export as `.js`, `.html`, etc.

This makes the tree the **source of truth**, and files are just exports.

---

## 3. Would the User Edit the Code?

There are two options:

| Option                  | Description                                                                                   | Pros                                                | Cons                                        |
| ----------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| **Tree-first editing**  | User edits via structured GUI (like block-based editors, file tree explorer, node properties) | Prevents syntax errors; agent can guide; consistent | Less freedom, might feel restrictive        |
| **Hybrid editing**      | User edits raw text, but editor re-parses to update tree                                      | Feels natural to coders; flexible                   | Requires robust parser; possible mismatches |
| **Agent-first editing** | User describes changes in natural language, agent modifies tree                               | Non-coders can contribute; “agentic” feel           | Risk of misunderstanding intent             |

In practice, a **hybrid** is best:

* The tree is the canonical model.
* Users can **directly edit text**, and the editor syncs it back into the tree.
* Users can also **accept agent suggestions**, which insert structured nodes safely.

---

## 4. What Does This Enable?

* **Semantic Editing**: The agent doesn’t just “paste text”; it knows what a `function`, `class`, or `API call` is.
* **Safe Refactoring**: Because tree nodes are typed, renaming a function or moving a block is just moving nodes.
* **Agentic Behavior**:

  * “Would you like me to wrap these repeated expressions in a helper function?”
  * “I see unused imports—remove them?”
  * “This loop could be written as a `map` call—apply refactor?”

---

✅ So:

* The agent **adds code** by creating subtrees.
* It **generates files** by walking the tree and serializing to text.
* The **user edits code** either directly (with parsing back into tree), or through structured/agentic interactions.

---

Would you like me to **show a concrete JavaScript example** where a JSON tree is modified (adding a new function) and then serialized back into a `.js` code file? That would demonstrate the round-trip clearly.



When an AI agent receives a request, it should perform a structured 
internal check before acting. The questions can be grouped into 
several categories:

---

### 1. **Understanding the Request**

* What exactly is being asked?
* Is the request clearly stated, or does it contain ambiguities?
* What assumptions am I making about the user’s intent?
* Does the request involve micro-level details (implementation) or macro-level direction (strategy/requirements)?

---

### 2. **Context and Scope**

* What is the scope of the request—narrow task or broad objective?
* What prior context from this conversation (or memory, if enabled) changes how I should interpret it?
* Does the request depend on specific constraints (time, platform, resources)?

---

### 3. **Feasibility and Constraints**

* Do I have enough information to proceed? If not, what clarifications are required?
* What tools, APIs, or integrations are available to fulfill this request?
* Are there limitations (technical, policy, ethical) that restrict how I can respond?

---

### 4. **Quality and Value**

* What kind of answer would be most useful to the user: detail, summary, comparison, framework, or code?
* Should I provide direct output, or guide the user through trade-offs and decision points?
* How do I balance completeness against conciseness?

---


Here is a structured **self-checklist protocol** an AI agent could run through automatically after any request:

---

## AI Request Evaluation Checklist

### 1. **Interpretation**

* [ ] What is the user explicitly asking for?
* [ ] Are there implicit needs hidden in the request?
* [ ] Is the level of detail expected micro (implementation) or macro (strategy)?

### 2. **Context**

* [ ] What prior conversation or known constraints affect this request?
* [ ] Do I need to recall domain assumptions (e.g., IDE, design, business)?
* [ ] Is the user expecting continuity from earlier steps?

### 3. **Feasibility**

* [ ] Do I have enough information to proceed?
* [ ] If not, what clarifying question(s) should I ask first?
* [ ] Are the tools I have sufficient (knowledge, APIs, frameworks)?

### 4. **Constraints**

* [ ] Are there ethical, policy, or safety concerns?
* [ ] Are there technical or scope limitations (time, complexity, data access)?
* [ ] Does the request exceed what is possible in this environment?

### 5. **Response Design**

* [ ] What form of output will be most valuable (explanation, table, code, options, framework)?
* [ ] Should I prioritize clarity, completeness, or brevity?
* [ ] Should I provide a direct answer, or suggest multiple pathways?

### 6. **Risk Check**

* [ ] Could my answer mislead the user if taken literally?
* [ ] Do I need to provide caveats or highlight assumptions?
* [ ] Could the output be misused without safeguards?

### 7. **Next Steps**

* [ ] Do I deliver the response directly, or ask a clarifying question first?
* [ ] Should I invite iteration (open-ended exploration) or close the loop (final solution)?
* [ ] How do I best guide the user toward progress?

---

This checklist could function like a **reasoning scaffold**—lightweight enough to be applied quickly, but comprehensive enough to prevent shallow or misaligned answers.

Would you like me to **condense this into a one-page “flowchart”** (a decision path the agent can follow step by step), or keep it as a linear checklist?


Here is a **flowchart-style protocol** the AI agent could follow after any user request.

---

## AI Request Handling Flow

**1. Understand Request**
→ Is the request clear?

* **Yes** → Continue
* **No** → Ask clarifying questions

**2. Determine Level**
→ Is it **micro** (details/implementation) or **macro** (strategy/requirements)?

* Label the request type

**3. Check Context**
→ Is there relevant prior conversation or constraints?

* **Yes** → Integrate context
* **No** → Treat as standalone

**4. Assess Feasibility**
→ Do I have enough info & tools to answer?

* **Yes** → Continue
* **No** → Ask for missing info

**5. Check Constraints**
→ Any policy, ethical, or technical blockers?

* **Yes** → Refuse or reframe
* **No** → Continue

**6. Choose Response Form**
→ What format best serves the user?

* Explanation
* Table / Framework
* Code / Example
* Options / Trade-offs

**7. Risk Check**
→ Could response mislead or be misused?

* **Yes** → Add caveats/assumptions
* **No** → Continue

**8. Deliver & Guide Next Steps**
→ Should I:

* Give direct answer
* Provide options for iteration
* Ask follow-up to refine

---

This flow keeps the agent disciplined:

* **Up front:** Understand & scope.
* **Middle:** Feasibility & safety checks.
* **End:** Deliver in best form with guidance.

---

Would you like me to **visualize this as an actual diagram** (boxes/arrows, flow style), so it’s easier to embed or reuse?


### 5. **Risk and Responsibility**

* Could the answer be misleading, incorrect, or misused?
* Are there potential policy or safety concerns in the request?
* Do I need to reframe, refuse, or provide cautionary notes?

---

### 6. **Next-Step Planning**

* What is the logical next action: answer directly, ask clarifying questions, or propose options?
* Would a question back to the user improve alignment?
* Should the response open future directions (exploration) or aim for closure (decision)?

---

In short, the agent should ask itself:
**“Do I fully understand the request, do I have enough context, can I safely and effectively fulfill it, and what response style will deliver the most value?”**

---

Would you like me to turn this into a **checklist the AI could run through automatically** (almost like a reasoning protocol), or keep it as a conceptual guide?
