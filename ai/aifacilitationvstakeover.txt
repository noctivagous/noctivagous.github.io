AI Facilitation vs. AI Takeover of Human Tasks

To facilitate cooking in the home, 
there is a vegetable-cutting appliance product 
for the kitchen that will cut or dice any vegetable 
placed inside its bounds.  The outer dimensions
are about the size of a larger microwave
and the end product reaches a price point that is 
relatively affordable when
manufactured at scale.  This device can be utilized
safely by the average citizen for convenient, at-home cooking.
Its purpose is limited to cutting and peeling of vegetables.
When the vegetables are taken out of the device
they should be ready for cooking.  The scraps are placed
to the side for disposal and the device does not
need to dispose of anything itself.  
When the vegetables are taken out of the device
they should be ready for cooking or assembling into
cold dishes for refrigeration.  In this way,
the device does not attempt to take over the entire
process of cooking but instead addresses an issue,
that vegetable cutting is a principal 
impediment to regular cooking at home.

Contrast this with the typical approaches for
making a kitchen appliance that incorporate AI: 
it will be a large scale robot that will have arms, it will cook, 
Apart from requiring more engineering and
AI technology than can be affordable for
the average person, it makes it unfeasible
for this product to be manufactured in
a reasonable amount of time, if ever.
The size of the device will be large, the
assembly will be complicated, and it will not
fit in an average household.  Thus the second
approach, the takeover of the whole process,
is a poor line of approach for utilizing AI.
It also stirs a person inside, as the entire
process has been taken over completely, 
supposedly for the purpose of making everyday
life easier.  

The goal of an AI device should not be to
make life easy but instead facilitate processes
that have been made complex because they
are missing pieces to the puzzle.  This is the
discussion of AI takeover versus AI facilitation.
AI takeover is the prevalent mindset at AI
companies whereas AI facilitation is basically
missing altogether, an absent topic.

In the short-term, it would be beneficial to
have a device that assists road construction
but does not try to take it all over from
beginning until end, because when a certain
shortcoming of the process has been addressed,
the solution provided by the AI will be much
more powerful, more feasible to actually
put on the market, and not replace humans.
It is actually preferable to it replacing
humans, as in the case of the vegetable cutting 
device that can sit next to the microwave.
The purpose of AI has been narrow on purpose
to deal with what is currently wrong for
people's process, not push people out of the
whole activity.
