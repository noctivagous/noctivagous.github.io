Test MCP Integration
Try asking me to use one of the MCP tools:

"Use the analyze_project_context tool to analyze this request: 'I want to build a web application for task management'"

The extension provides intelligent form generation that adapts to different project types and complexity levels, making it easier to collect structured requirements for AI assistants.
