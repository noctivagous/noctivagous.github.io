    Skia has multiple backends which receive SkCanvas drawing commands. 
    Each backend has a unique way of creating a SkCanvas. 
    This page gives an example for each:

    Raster ---- 
    The raster backend draws to a block of memory. This memory can be managed by Skia or by the client.

    The recommended way of creating a canvas for the Raster and Ganesh backends is to 
    use a SkSurface, which is an object that manages the memory into which the canvas commands are drawn.

    SkSurface is an object that manages the memory into which the canvas commands are drawn.

    Get a canvas (SkCanvas) from the surface.  
    
    SkCanvas* rasterCanvas = rasterSurface->getCanvas();


    SkPDF ----
    The SkPDF backend uses SkDocument instead of SkSurface, since a document must include multiple pages.

    SkPicture ----
    The SkPicture backend uses SkPictureRecorder instead of SkSurface.

    SkXPS ----
    The (still experimental) SkXPS canvas writes into an XPS document.

    SkSVG ----
    The (still experimental) SkSVG canvas writes into an SVG document.



    SkCanvas is the drawing context for Skia. 
    It knows where to direct the drawing (i.e. where the screen of offscreen pixels are), 
    and maintains a stack of matrices and clips. Note however, that unlike similar contexts 
    in other APIs like postscript, cairo, or awt, Skia does not store any other drawing 
    attributes in the context (e.g. color, pen size). Rather, these are specified explicitly 
    in each draw call, via a SkPaint.
