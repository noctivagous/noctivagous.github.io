# Troubleshooting Edge Cases - Early Injection

## Overview

This guide covers specific edge cases and unusual scenarios you might encounter with KeyPilot's instant interface system. These situations are rare but can occur on certain websites or under specific conditions.

## Website-Specific Issues

### Single Page Applications (SPAs)

**Issue**: Interface appears and disappears during SPA navigation
**Affected Sites**: Gmail, Twitter, Facebook, modern web apps
**Symptoms**:
- HUD flickers during navigation within the app
- Cursor briefly disappears when clicking internal links
- Settings seem to reset momentarily

**Solutions**:
1. **Wait for Stabilization**: Interface should stabilize within 1-2 seconds
2. **Refresh the Page**: Full page reload often resolves SPA conflicts
3. **Use Alt+H**: Toggle HUD off and on to reset state

**Why This Happens**: SPAs modify the page without full reloads, which can interfere with the two-phase loading system.

### Content Security Policy (CSP) Restrictions

**Issue**: Interface appears with minimal or broken styling
**Affected Sites**: Banking sites, government portals, security-focused websites
**Symptoms**:
- HUD appears but looks unstyled (plain text)
- Cursor shows as basic crosshair without colors
- Functionality works but appearance is degraded

**Solutions**:
1. **Accept Degraded Appearance**: Functionality remains intact
2. **Check Browser Console**: Look for CSP violation messages
3. **Report to Website**: Some sites may whitelist the extension

**Why This Happens**: Strict CSP policies block inline styles that provide the polished appearance.

### Heavy JavaScript Websites

**Issue**: Delayed full functionality despite instant appearance
**Affected Sites**: Complex web applications, data visualization sites
**Symptoms**:
- HUD and cursor appear instantly
- Some features don't work immediately (5-10 seconds)
- Keyboard shortcuts may be delayed

**Solutions**:
1. **Wait for Full Load**: Complete functionality loads once page stabilizes
2. **Avoid Rapid Navigation**: Let pages fully load before navigating
3. **Use Simpler Pages**: Test on basic websites to confirm extension works

**Why This Happens**: Heavy page scripts can delay the second phase of initialization.

## Browser-Specific Issues

### Chrome Incognito Mode

**Issue**: Settings don't persist between incognito sessions
**Symptoms**:
- HUD settings reset when closing incognito windows
- Extension state doesn't sync between incognito tabs
- Interface appears but with default settings

**Solutions**:
1. **Expected Behavior**: Incognito mode doesn't persist data by design
2. **Configure Each Session**: Set preferences in each incognito session
3. **Use Regular Mode**: For persistent settings, use regular browsing

### Chrome with Multiple Profiles

**Issue**: Settings don't sync between Chrome profiles
**Symptoms**:
- Different HUD states in different Chrome profiles
- Extension behaves differently across profiles
- Settings changes don't affect other profiles

**Solutions**:
1. **Configure Each Profile**: Set preferences separately for each profile
2. **Use Chrome Sync**: Enable Chrome sync for consistent experience
3. **Manual Configuration**: Copy settings between profiles if needed

### Browser Extensions Conflicts

**Issue**: Other extensions interfere with instant interface
**Common Conflicts**: Ad blockers, other keyboard extensions, page modifiers
**Symptoms**:
- Interface doesn't appear instantly
- Keyboard shortcuts don't work
- Visual elements appear in wrong positions

**Solutions**:
1. **Disable Other Extensions**: Test with other extensions disabled
2. **Check Extension Order**: KeyPilot should load early in the list
3. **Report Conflicts**: Identify specific conflicting extensions

## Hardware and System Issues

### High DPI Displays

**Issue**: Interface elements appear too small or mispositioned
**Affected Systems**: 4K monitors, high-resolution laptops, scaled displays
**Symptoms**:
- HUD appears very small in corner
- Cursor crosshair is barely visible
- Interface elements overlap with page content

**Solutions**:
1. **Adjust Browser Zoom**: Use Ctrl/Cmd + to increase zoom
2. **Check Display Scaling**: Verify OS display scaling settings
3. **Reset Browser Zoom**: Try 100% zoom first, then adjust

### Multiple Monitor Setups

**Issue**: Interface appears on wrong monitor or in wrong position
**Symptoms**:
- HUD appears on secondary monitor when browsing on primary
- Cursor positioning is offset
- Interface jumps between monitors

**Solutions**:
1. **Use Primary Monitor**: Test on primary monitor first
2. **Check Display Settings**: Verify monitor arrangement in OS settings
3. **Restart Browser**: Close and reopen browser on correct monitor

### Low-End Hardware

**Issue**: Delayed interface appearance on slower computers
**Symptoms**:
- Interface takes 100-200ms to appear (still faster than before)
- Slight lag in keyboard shortcuts
- Browser feels less responsive

**Solutions**:
1. **Close Unnecessary Tabs**: Reduce memory usage
2. **Disable Other Extensions**: Free up processing power
3. **Restart Browser**: Clear memory leaks from long sessions

## Network and Connectivity Issues

### Slow Internet Connections

**Issue**: Interface appears but some features don't work immediately
**Symptoms**:
- HUD shows but toggle switches don't respond
- Cursor appears but mode switching is delayed
- Cross-tab sync is slow or fails

**Solutions**:
1. **Wait for Full Load**: Allow extra time for complete initialization
2. **Check Connection**: Verify internet connectivity
3. **Reload Extension**: Restart extension if sync fails

### Offline Browsing

**Issue**: Interface works but settings don't sync
**Symptoms**:
- HUD and cursor appear normally
- Settings changes don't persist
- Cross-tab sync doesn't work

**Solutions**:
1. **Expected Behavior**: Sync requires internet connection
2. **Local Changes**: Settings work within current session
3. **Reconnect**: Settings sync when connection restored

## Advanced Edge Cases

### Browser Developer Tools Open

**Issue**: Interface positioning affected by DevTools
**Symptoms**:
- HUD appears in wrong position when DevTools is docked
- Cursor positioning is offset
- Interface overlaps with DevTools panels

**Solutions**:
1. **Undock DevTools**: Use separate window for DevTools
2. **Adjust HUD Position**: Interface adapts to available space
3. **Close DevTools**: Test without DevTools open

### Browser Zoom Levels

**Issue**: Interface scaling issues at extreme zoom levels
**Affected Zoom**: Below 50% or above 200%
**Symptoms**:
- HUD becomes too small or too large
- Cursor crosshair scaling issues
- Text becomes unreadable

**Solutions**:
1. **Use Standard Zoom**: Keep zoom between 75% and 150%
2. **Reset Zoom**: Use Ctrl/Cmd + 0 to reset to 100%
3. **Gradual Adjustment**: Change zoom in small increments

### Page Refresh During Loading

**Issue**: Interface state becomes inconsistent
**Symptoms**:
- HUD appears twice briefly
- Cursor shows wrong mode
- Settings appear corrupted

**Solutions**:
1. **Wait for Stabilization**: Interface corrects itself within seconds
2. **Hard Refresh**: Use Ctrl/Cmd + Shift + R
3. **Toggle Extension**: Use Alt+K to reset state

### Rapid Tab Switching

**Issue**: Interface state lags behind tab switches
**Symptoms**:
- HUD shows wrong state when switching tabs quickly
- Cursor mode doesn't match current tab
- Settings appear to flicker

**Solutions**:
1. **Slow Down Switching**: Allow 1 second between tab switches
2. **Wait for Sync**: State corrects itself automatically
3. **Manual Reset**: Use Alt+H to refresh HUD state

## Diagnostic Tools

### Quick Status Check

Run this in browser console to check system status:

```javascript
function checkEarlyInjectionStatus() {
  const status = {
    earlyInjectionActive: !!document.querySelector('[data-kpv2-early-injection]'),
    hudPresent: !!document.getElementById('kpv2-hud'),
    cursorPresent: !!document.getElementById('kpv2-cursor'),
    mainScriptLoaded: !!window.KeyPilot,
    timestamp: document.querySelector('[data-kpv2-early-injection]')?.dataset.timestamp
  };
  
  console.table(status);
  
  if (!status.earlyInjectionActive) {
    console.error('❌ Early injection not active - check extension installation');
  } else if (!status.mainScriptLoaded) {
    console.warn('⚠️ Main script not loaded - wait for page to finish loading');
  } else {
    console.log('✅ Early injection system working correctly');
  }
  
  return status;
}

checkEarlyInjectionStatus();
```

### Performance Check

Check if early injection is impacting page performance:

```javascript
function checkPerformanceImpact() {
  const navigation = performance.getEntriesByType('navigation')[0];
  const earlyInjectionTime = document.querySelector('[data-kpv2-early-injection]')?.dataset.timestamp;
  
  if (earlyInjectionTime && navigation) {
    const impact = earlyInjectionTime - navigation.fetchStart;
    console.log(`Early injection impact: ${impact.toFixed(2)}ms`);
    
    if (impact > 10) {
      console.warn('⚠️ Performance impact higher than expected');
    } else {
      console.log('✅ Performance impact within acceptable range');
    }
  }
}

checkPerformanceImpact();
```

### Extension Communication Test

Test communication between extension components:

```javascript
function testExtensionCommunication() {
  chrome.runtime.sendMessage({type: 'PING'}, (response) => {
    if (chrome.runtime.lastError) {
      console.error('❌ Extension communication failed:', chrome.runtime.lastError);
    } else if (response) {
      console.log('✅ Extension communication working');
    } else {
      console.warn('⚠️ Extension not responding - try reloading');
    }
  });
}

testExtensionCommunication();
```
