A Declarative Application XML Format

The issue being addresed  is that app SDKs are still providing very low level 
conventions for writing apps, such as having people manually specify,
inside keyDown event functions, each key combination with if statements.
There is too much like this that is a common activity that can be
abstracted into higher-level components, and then when this is done the
apps can be constructed more rapidly because the right utilities are in place. 
Today's app SDKs, and for the last few decades, have just been supplying direct 
functions, variables, and object classes that work inside the programming 
languages.  They aren't identifying situations where the work is unnecessarily 
tedious and manual for the job of making an app.

Consider:

    - Programming inside keyDown(), mouseDown(), mouseDragged(), etc. for more
    than simple scenarios is too low level and is the wrong software 
    architecture for apps requiring complex input software designs.
        - The example: 
        Programming each key's corresponding character code 
        and what it does inside an if statement in a keyDown() event function 
        vs. 
        A keyMap property list that
        defines actions (functions to call) for keyDown, keyUp for each keyCode.  
        
        

    - This is then rearchitected further to a higher level and into
    a different set of concepts.   The keyMap can be wrapped inside an 
    input context (inputContext) so that it is self-contained
    and separated from other inputContexts of the app, as needed.  For the same window,
    different inputContexts might be swapped out.
        
        - An inputContext covers a set of input definitions (e.g. key mappings)
        for a loaded context, which can be swapped out.  Within an inputContext, there
        are additional conventions to make swapping out different types of
        input interactions possible.  Thus other aspects become modular
        and swappable.
    - Conventions are provided in this application format
    and states and workflows are natively supported.


In short, there are many app scenarios that could be set up completely 
in a declarative file format, it's just that more conveniences and 
other conventions need to be provided that result from identifying 
various patterns where the programmer is involve in relatively low level code
for making an app.  Then these patterns, which occur in many places in
the code of application software development,can be re-architected into 
higher-level components, building on top of the declarative app formats of
past, such as MXML and XUL.

A calculator app is an example we use because it should be, by now, 
describable through a provided set of higher-level conceptual components 
that make it easy to construct at the outset.  They are components that haven't
existed before in any app SDK because, to begin with, they address the
inadequacies and oversights of existing SDKs when they ask the software developer
to write certain code situations with the bare tools of the programming language.

By placing this inside an XML format we also address the integration of
GUI into the app code as well.

--> Is cross-platform as long as a runtime or interpreter 
is built for any given programming language and system.


A set of these components will be generalized so that they can be utilized in 
other app scenarios as well.


This kit can be developed while testing it against different scenarios,
calculator, a tetris-style game, vector-editor, and then.


APPLICATION SETUP

- app <app id="com.example.calculator" version="1.0">
- appSettings


- Application Scenes <appScene>
--- Like game scenes, can be swapped out.
--- Can be inside a <window> or wrap a <window> or <windowGroup>.



INPUT CONTEXTS

- Input Contexts <inputContext>
--- Swaps out the events within an appScene.
--- example:
    In an inputContext, a list of buttons (<button>), such as for a calculator,
    carry an attribute not only for what happens when they are pressed (onPress),
    but also a keyMapping attribute to indicate which key activates
    them.  By placing them inside a inputContext, their
    keyMappings


KEY MAPPINGS

- Key Map <keyMap>
---Is a property list placed inside an input context for keyboard actions.

- Key Mappings <keyMapping>
---The mapping for a specific key.

- Key Mapping Action <keymappingAction event="keyDown">
--- The action for an event for a specific key. Placed inside a <keyMapping>.


<keyMap>
                <keymapping keyCode="48" label="0">
                        <keymappingAction event="keyDown" target="#display" action="append" value="0"/>
                    </keymapping>
                    <keymapping keyCode="49" label="1">
                        <keymappingAction event="keyDown" target="#display" action="append" value="1"/>
                    </keymapping>
                    <keymapping keyCode="50" label="2">
                        <keymappingAction event="keyDown" target="#display" action="append" value="2"/>
                    </keymapping>
</keyMap>
                    
                    
ARRAYS

- Selected Item Array <selectedItemArray>,<selectedItemsArray> 
--- Wraps a list that has a selected index
--- For multiple scenarios both inside the code and to set up GUI controls with indices.
--- Default index value is 0



- Converters <converter>
--- <valueConverter name="radToDeg" type="float" ... >


---

<app> 
<appScene name="Calculator"> 
<inputContext> 
<!-- selectedItemArray wraps a list, allows swapping active element, such as swapping out the active keyMapping ---> <selectedItemArray active="first"> <keyMappings> <keymapping hid="" keyCode="1" modifiers=""> <keymappingAction event="keyDown"> </keymappingAction> </keymapping> </keyMappings> </selectedItemArray> </inputContext> </appScene> </app>
