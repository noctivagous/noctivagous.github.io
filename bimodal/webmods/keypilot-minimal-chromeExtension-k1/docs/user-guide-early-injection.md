# KeyPilot Early Injection - User Guide

## What's New: Instant Interface

KeyPilot now provides **instant visual feedback** when you navigate between pages. The HUD and cursor appear immediately (within 50ms) instead of waiting for pages to fully load, creating a seamless and persistent interface experience.

## Key Improvements

### Before: Delayed Interface
- HUD and cursor appeared only after pages finished loading (2-5 seconds)
- Jarring "pop-in" effect during navigation
- Interface felt disconnected between pages

### After: Instant Interface
- ✅ HUD appears within 50ms of page navigation
- ✅ Cursor appears within 50ms of page navigation  
- ✅ No visual flickering during page loads
- ✅ Interface feels persistent and seamless
- ✅ Settings maintained across all navigation

## How It Works

KeyPilot now uses a **two-phase loading system**:

1. **Instant Phase**: Critical visual elements appear immediately when you start navigating
2. **Full Phase**: Complete functionality loads after the page is ready

This means you see the interface instantly while maintaining all the powerful features you're used to.

## Troubleshooting

### Interface Not Appearing Instantly

**If the HUD or cursor still takes time to appear:**

1. **Check Extension Status**
   - Ensure KeyPilot is enabled (Alt+K to toggle)
   - Verify extension is active in chrome://extensions/
   - Look for the KeyPilot icon in your browser toolbar

2. **Reload Extension**
   - Go to chrome://extensions/
   - Find KeyPilot and click "Reload"
   - Test on a new page

3. **Clear Extension Data**
   - Right-click KeyPilot icon → Options
   - Reset settings if available
   - Or disable/re-enable the extension

### Settings Not Persisting

**If your HUD settings reset when navigating:**

1. **Check Storage Permissions**
   - Extension needs storage permission to save settings
   - Reload extension if recently updated

2. **Test Cross-Tab Sync**
   - Open multiple tabs
   - Change HUD settings in one tab
   - Verify changes appear in other tabs within 1 second

3. **Browser Storage Issues**
   - Try incognito mode to test
   - Clear browser data if persistent issues
   - Check if other extensions conflict

### Performance Issues

**If pages load slower after the update:**

1. **Measure Impact**
   - The improvement should add less than 10ms to page load
   - Test on different websites to isolate issues

2. **Check Browser Resources**
   - Close unnecessary tabs
   - Disable other extensions temporarily
   - Restart browser if memory usage is high

3. **Report Performance Issues**
   - Note specific websites where slowdown occurs
   - Include browser version and OS information
   - Use browser's Performance tab to measure timing

### Visual Glitches

**If you see flickering or positioning issues:**

1. **Page-Specific Issues**
   - Some websites may have conflicting styles
   - Try refreshing the page
   - Test on different websites

2. **Browser Zoom Issues**
   - Reset browser zoom to 100%
   - Test interface positioning
   - Adjust zoom gradually if needed

3. **Display Settings**
   - Check if using multiple monitors
   - Verify display scaling settings
   - Test on different screen resolutions
