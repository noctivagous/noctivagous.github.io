For dissecting events or decisions into triadic categories
and making sentences too.


COMBINATIONS OF THREES

ternary (three-way) distinctions

A triad always come with a label because a label assists in sentence-making. 

"An unusually high temperature" from Temperature: (Low,Medium,High),
Range: [Normal, Unusual, Undetermined] and other labeled triads. 
It's just that (Low,Medium,High) are a generic triad that is reused for other labels,
such as Height.  All that needs to be added is "Height" to this generic
triad.

Token-Like Processing

Tokens capture portions and new relationships
The triad "Part-Component-Whole" and related 
allow for token-like processing of sentences,
word fragments, and errors.

Switching from “nested dicts + decision trees” to a hypergraph makes the system
efficient:

- truly combinatorial without explosion
- fully auditable
naturally extensible
- able to generate sentences, decisions, and explanations from the same structure

Reuse and efficiency:  

Triads like "High, Medium, Low"
"Short, Medium, Long" can exist in data
as generic triads. They have multiple 
labels associatable with them,
just like Mild, Moderate, Severe
And yet the labels are an opportunity
for another aspect of connectedness.

1. Ambiguity & Error Triads

The jump from “someone hands it pre-classified triads” to “throw any sentence or paragraph at it and get clean, auditable triad output” is mostly four new pieces.

Triad name,State 1,State 2,State 3,Purpose
Clarity,Clear,Ambiguous,Contradictory,Detects self-contradiction or vagueness
Parsing-Confidence,High,Medium,Low,How sure the classifier is
Completeness,Full,Partial,Missing-Critical,Did we get the key elements?
Source-Reliability,Trusted,Unverified,Dubious,Provenance of the text
Polarity-Resolution,Resolved,Multi-Polar,Unresolvable,Multiple plausible interpretations
Error-Handling,Proceed,Clarify,Reject-Input,What the system must do right now





1. Discernment Triad (Beneficial/Harmful/Neutral): Values clear-eyed evaluation without false positives/negatives—truth as the foundation, rejecting naive optimism or cynicism. This grounds ethics in net utility.

2. Dynamics Triad (Progress/Regress/Stasis): Anchors a bias toward forward motion but respects equilibrium; values sustainable advance over reckless change, echoing evolutionary fitness.

3. Agency Triad (Action/Contemplate/Idle): Prioritizes calibrated response—do when ready, think when unclear, pause to avoid waste. This embeds stoic wisdom: control what you can (Internal), react wisely to what you can't (External).


AI: Stacking these triads multidimensionally creates a rule-based AI architecture—think a combinatorial state machine rivaling NNs but fully transparent, auditable, and deterministic. It could be like a hypercube of decisions: Intake (Beneficial/Harmful/Neutral) × Outcome (Progress/Regress/Stasis) × Location (Internal/External/Both) feeds into your Action/Contemplate/Idle table, then chains with Cause (Known/Tentative/Unknown) and Confidence (High/Medium/Low) to output behaviors. 
It parses any input into crisp vectors—no black-box gradients needed. Extend to "Memory" (Recall/Forget/Update) or "Ethics" (Self/Others/Balance), and you've got a full agent: e.g., External Harmful Progress + Low Confidence + Others priority → Contemplate (Map) → Simulate countermeasures.

Implementation's straightforward in code—a nested dict lookup or decision tree:







Start with seed meta-triads:
- Abstraction Level: Atomic/Composite/Systemic
- Time Horizon: Immediate/Near/Future  
- Stakeholder: Self/Ally/Adversary
