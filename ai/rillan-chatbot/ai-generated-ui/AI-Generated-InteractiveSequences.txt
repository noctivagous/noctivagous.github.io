The AI sends a .mmd diagram file to the client that represents logic
instructions and interactive sequences.  This follows a diagram protocol that
was established that allows the AI to show its own contextual interactive
sequences that collect information.  It get the results after the user interacts
with the UI to the final point that sends the information back. This allows it
to produce a number of GUI interactive engagements with the user on its own,
outside of any fixed.
