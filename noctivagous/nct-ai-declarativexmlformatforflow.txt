nct-ai-declarativexmlformatforflow


A raw chatbot script is a back and forth
determined by.

But you might want to use an editable, 
declarative XML format to guide it, which would 
allow putting together various system prompts,
defining different modes, providing 
different logic sequences (such as with
<switch> and <if>/<ifelse> tags), flow,
and workflow.

So then there would be something like
chatbotxmlinterpreter.py that interprets
this XML format so that you can take
an app and load (or reload this script)
after editing.

(It also points to scenarios of hot reloading
code that is interpreted from XML in
a language like Python, where all of the
running program is discarded on reload.)

Instructions in this format would allow
defining sequences and instructions
for what GUI to add to the window,
(what window to make).  Instructions
would include how to handle the response
from the AI model.
