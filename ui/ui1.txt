Many user interface principles for interaction design have gone unrecognized but are present
in existing products like desktop computers, mobile touchscreen phones,
and touchscreen tablets.  The following applies to the use of personal
computers for long periods of time for work.

-- The arms and hands should generally be relaxed and lay flat for long 
periods of time and the user interface should almost never require lifting the arms up to the screen
or midair.


-- Physical resistance is needed generally for user interfaces and flat, unresponsive
environments are less than ideal.  A physical button or other control provides
the necessary sensation of resistance, as does a rotary knob or thumbwheel found
on the side of a device.  An experience of physical feedback is preferable to the benefits of
dynamic user interface given by a tablet screen.

-- User interface targets for virtual ("spatial") computing should not be in midair, 
on flat surfaces repurposed for control.  Instead, interaction 
hardware should be in use that is multipurpose, carrying a variety of controls.
