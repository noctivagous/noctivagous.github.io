In an improved situation, shouldn't the AI be executing commands that construct
a program instead of writing detailed lines of code that make up the program?  The latter
is much more error prone and there is a lot of rewriting of the basics carried out 
by the AI.  It's like the following. If the AI only generates commands that 
insert objects into the DOM, sometimes this is better than it writing all of the HTML tags.  
If it has higher level calls provided to it that make the program in terms of
topics, this is surely better than having it write many lines of code.  To make
a GUI grid for the program, it can execute a provided command MAKEGRID instead
of generating 100 lines of code that make a grid.
