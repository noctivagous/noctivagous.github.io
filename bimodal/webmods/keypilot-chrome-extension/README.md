### üéõÔ∏è Modes



## üìù Text Selection Features

KeyPilot offers two powerful text selection modes that both show the same visual rectangle overlay:

### Character-Level Selection (H key - Default)
- **Natural text flow**: Selects text character by character within the rectangle, following natural reading flow
- **Cross-element selection**: Works seamlessly across different HTML elements and text nodes
- **Rectangle overlay**: Shows the same visual rectangle as rectangle mode for consistent UX
- **Usage**: Press H to start, move cursor to extend rectangle, press H again to copy text within rectangle

### Rectangle Selection (R key)
- **Area-based selection**: Selects all text that intersects with the rectangular region
- **Column selection**: Perfect for selecting columns of data or specific rectangular text areas
- **Same visual rectangle**: Uses identical rectangle overlay as character mode
- **Usage**: Press R to start, drag to create rectangle, press R again to copy all text in rectangle

### Unified Visual Experience
- **Same Rectangle Overlay**: Both modes show identical visual rectangle during selection
- **Different Selection Logic**: H selects flowing text within rectangle, R selects all intersecting text
- **Consistent Interaction**: Same drag-to-extend behavior for both modes
- **Mode Indicators**: Clear labels show which selection type is active

### Selection Workflow
1. Position cursor over desired text
2. Press **H** for character selection or **R** for rectangle selection
3. Move cursor to extend selection rectangle (same visual feedback for both modes)
4. Press **H** or **R** again to copy selected text to clipboard
5. Press **ESC** to cancel selection without copying

Both modes provide identical visual feedback with the rectangle overlay, but use different text selection algorithms underneath.
