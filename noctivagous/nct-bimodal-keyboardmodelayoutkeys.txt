In Bimodal Control Theory, often
individual keyboard keys are repurposed to
activated functions and this also
means that the keyboard's mappings can
be changed to different sets of functions
or layouts for them.  It can then 
return to normal typing.

In this case, the modifier keys can
be replaced with a different convention
that is also backwards-compatible.


KEYBOARD MODE KEYS INSTEAD OF MODIFIER KEYS

The Function keys could be put into
a different role.  They could be
made MODE keys that change the keyboard
keys into individual actions.

The mode of the keyboard would return
to TYPING and be backwards compatible
with old shortcuts by just using the
Function keys.  And the use of Function
keys for keyboard modes can be turned
off with a key sequence.


Example: Quitting An App

Instead of Control+Q or Command+Q,
having to hold down the modifier before
hitting Q.  To quit an app:

1. PRESS "APP ACTION" MODE KEY (assigned to F1)

2. PRESS "Q" KEY

3. (App quits. The Keyboard mode exits "APP ACTION" mode
and returns to the "STANDARD" mode, which is how
computers work today).

The situation of pressing two keys in
a sequence like this provides the user 
much superior dexterity for hitting the
Q button compared to having to
hold down a modifier key.  This is the
Bimodal Control Theory aspect to the situation.

The APP ACTION mode key includes actions 
that pertain to an app.  Paste might be
assigned to F5 under APP MODE (Press F1, then F5,
then keyboard mode returns to normal typing).
